# Review

Very very funny. Made me start liking [[People/Woody Allen\|Woody Allen]]... The movie is basically just him and [[People/Diane Keaton\|Diane Keaton]] going back and forth with each other. It felt exceedingly modern. The entire style with the fourth wall breaks, the meta humor, this was very ahead of its time. How many movies and TV shows are exactly this? But I do think that despite the meta framing, we never lost the heart. The relationship between Alvy and Annie is very well drawn. It's minimalistic, but we see everything we need to. The movie is already a nice breezy hour and a half, but with how enjoyable and funny it was, I found it flying by despite it.
