# Review

Excellent film. I want more movies that have a clear direction, are very well-acted, and don't get caught up in needless complexity. Strange Darling was a great example in how exercising restraint can elevate rather than hold one back. The Lady steals the show here, but both her and the Demon are joys to watch. There were two scenes that stood out to me as my favorite and both were great examples of lighting/color. The first is the one where they're talking to each other in the car. The blue neon glow of the hotel sign fills the scene. And the second is when the Lady is in the hotel bathroom and everything is so red. Cleverly hiding the blood we know is on her after that whole everything that happened in the hotel room.

Something else I really enjoyed was the 90 minute runtime. I want more films to be pushed back to 90 minutes. There are way too many movies that overstay their welcome and I can feel that taking the editing scissors to them would be a big improvement.
