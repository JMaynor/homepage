# Review

This was way less depressing than [[Movies/Network (1976)\|Network (1976)]]. I rather enjoyed it. I think perhaps I've been too hard on musicals in the past. I think it was just Le Mis. Of the ones on the List, they've got a pretty good track record going. The shadow the Nazis cast was great and terrible but the Kit Kat Klub made things ok. I saw cabaret in theater once and the movie was way better. Not knocking their performance, I just like some of the changes. All the songs being in the Klub. It also seemed way more focused on the main characters than the play was, which I think was good narratively. Fun comparing Liza as Sally in Cabaret to Lucille in Arrested Development.
