# Review

This genuinely feels like one of the weirdest "movie" movies I've seen in quite a long time. And what I mean is, it's a genuine movie, not an experience. Like a Neil Breen or something where it's a movie only very technically. Friendship is a movie that could have been seen in the theaters and that's a bit wild.

So this film is billed as a comedy. Kind of. Also horror? The strongest description I can give is social horror. I can feel the I Think You Should Leave energy here. I'm also getting strong Tim and Eric Bedtime Stories vibes. The Hole in particular. The film stars Tim Robinson (good for him) and how his life changes after meeting Paul Rudd. It is exceptionally weird. Like truly very weird. There is some laughing to be had in this comedy. Though not nearly as much as you might expect. And the social horror causes much cringing. I really don't know how I feel about it.

Much of the first 2/3 or so of the movie feels like an extended I Think You Should Leave sketch. To the point where there are multiple scene cuts where I was inserting the ITYSL transition/intro music in my head. The movie both flies by and also feels like such a slog. I felt a bit like I was watching a series of sketches that had been cut together. I don't know that it entirely works for me. It's very good at making you uncomfortable. I was smiling with glee watching the first couple scenes of reverse I Love You Man play out. It's all so absurd Paul Rudd immediately befriending Tim's weirdo character. And then we get to the turn.

I said "Oh no" out loud when it happened. And for the rest of the film I just cringed more and more watching the train wreck in front of me. It's very effective. But I can't help feel the latter half or third of the film lingers a bit too long. It's rather dark. Comedic in the absurdity of how quickly things fall apart, I suppose. But it's also a bit miserable. Just very strange. Very much feels like a "someone had an idea". Which I appreciate seeing, but I wouldn't say no to it being a bit shorter. Or at least moving the turn a bit farther into the film, perhaps.

I think I liked it. Kind of.
