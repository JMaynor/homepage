# Review

Amazing film. Have seen it several times now, I think 4. I love having a modern movie that is so well-received that pretty much directly mirrors my own position on life and philosophy. I.E. absurdism. I have few things to even say about the film because it's just so consistently good.

One little thing I will share, though that I noticed on this most recent watch. The very first thing that we see in the film. The very first scene is a shot in that little mirror in the home area above the laundromat. We see Evelyn, Waymond, and Joy happy and celebrating something. Something knocks the mirror and we transition to another reflection of the room. In the language of movies, this is obviously a time skip. We see the family happy and then transition to the current times where we get into the drama. But that's not what we're actually seeing. The reflection isn't the past, it's another universe. Literally the very first thing that we see in this film, before we start to delve into any of the nihilism is a complete confirmation that this family isn't broken. They can be happy. We see them happy somewhere else. It's super clever and one of many small tender moments in a very tender and loving movie.
