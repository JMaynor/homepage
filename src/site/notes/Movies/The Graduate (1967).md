# Review

Holy shit. I love Mike Nichols. Once I realized this was the same director as [[Movies/Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (1966)\|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf]], everything came together. I love the high drama scary words-are-daggers movies this guy makes. It's so good and so frightening. Mrs. Robinson terrified me so much. Just anytime she was on screen, really. Adulthood is scary, you know?

That ending was haunting. What next? It was very effectively done. The small facial movements. Happiness, turning to uncertainty, [[People/Dustin Hoffman\|Dustin Hoffman]] was great as he always is. I can see why he became a star. He was so young here, just a little boy. A little boy becoming a man after fucking an older woman in a hotel room.
