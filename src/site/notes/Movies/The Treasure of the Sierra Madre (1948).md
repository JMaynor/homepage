# Review

Was excited to see one of the points of reference used for my favorite DLC of [[Games/Fallout New Vegas (2010)\|Fallout New Vegas]]. And it was definitely fun. Could see exactly where everything was going. Greed corrupting all of course. But it was still enjoyable to see. Multiple times I was saying out loud, "What if we just stopped now and left? We could do that. Nothing's stopping us." The scene where God blows the gold dust away into the wind was heartbreaking. How could God test me in such a way? I can't imagine getting the gold bars from the Sierra Madre casino and then having them taken away. Devilish.

In particular I enjoyed seeing how different [[People/Humphrey Bogart\|Humphrey Bogart]] was in Sierra compared to his performance in [[Movies/The African Queen (1952)\|The African Queen]]. So completely different.
