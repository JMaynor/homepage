# Review

Wholly unexpected film. Was not remotely what I was expecting it to be. I was incredibly surprised when the clear turn happens when Fran is in Baxter's apartment. All I saw was the basic plot summary from the Wikipedia intro and my eyes caught "romantic comedy" (missing the drama portion of it). I had mostly discounted it and was a bit disappointed we were watching yet another romantic comedy for the list. I know people like being happy, but I do have a soft spot for the French film where everything is shit and bad and the characters die and we end with Fin.

But I was quite happy to see how deep some of these characters were. Everyone was surprisingly multifaceted. Partially because I went in expecting a comedy and not a drama, but even then. Sheldrake is obviously the villain but he's not like maniacal or anything. And everyone else is just regular people. No one was wholly unreasonable, either. Even with the wacko premise. I still don't know why these people can't get another apartment to diddle in, but whatever.

Another takeaway, hat laws are nonsense.
