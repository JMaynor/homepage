# Review

Alright let's get into it. This is a movie about America. Alex hated it.

Moving swiftly along, I'll start with what I felt was the glaring negative. I think Nashville is way too long. I think you could have pretty safely cut out like 30-40 minutes of it without losing much. Now, the Nashville fan tulpa I conjure in my mind, I imagine countering with "it has to be that long, that's the point. It's an epic and you'll be losing important portions of it." But I do feel that, from what I got out of the movie, I could have gotten the same takeaways in like 1 hour  and 45 minutes to 2 hours.

I think a lot has to be said about the general level of acting they got out of these actors. It's kind of wild with the ensemble cast that there were multiple times where I felt like I was just watching a group of people, rather than actors. People just talking. And everyone was a person. It was crazy. The movie could have, at any point, chosen to just start following one of its many many people and I would have been totally satisfied learning more about their story.

But Nashville isn't about any of these single people, it's about America. Specifically, I think the cultural upheaval post-Kennedy assassination. Sort of a good pair with the innocence of Lucas' [[Movies/American Graffiti (1973)\|American Graffiti (1973)]]. We go from Mel's Drive In to this insanity. I struggle to get deeper than that, because this is a really dense movie. Like to me it's fudge. But a lot of fudge. And you really just want a little bit of fudge, not an entire plateful.

I don't ever wanna watch it again, and I don't wanna watch another movie that is like it. But I also quite enjoyed it.
