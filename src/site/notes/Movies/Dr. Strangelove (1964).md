# Review

The more Kubrick movies we watch on this list, the more obscene it becomes that [[Movies/The Shining (1980)\|The Shining]] is not on it. I don't understand. I don't understand. Why does AFI hate horror?

 I don't like how pedestrian everything is as we approach the end of the world. I had seen the movie previously, so I'm aware of how it ends. But even still, Kubrick approached Hitchcockian levels of suspense in this one. I wanted to scream, "Why isn't anyone doing anything?!" Every step we take towards the end, just watching it play out. Every goddamn time we switch back to the bomber. Very fun and so dark. I know that the "gentlemen, no fighting in the war room" is probably one of the most well-known lines from the film. For me, it's when the army man gets the spare change for Mandrake when he's trying to phone the President by shooting the vending machine. "You're gonna have to answer to the Coca-Cola company." Pitch black and hilarious. The movie as a whole is very funny. Definitely the funniest Kubrick that I've seen thus far.
