# Review

Let's learn about Watergate and that Nixon bastard! I really loved this one. Was on the edge of my seat and it was all so interesting as well. There was some really well-framed shots that stood out to me. The one's where we get a closeup of the TV showing Nixon news in the WaPo office and you see Woodward and/or Bernstein typing up the stories that will eventually doom him in the background. Honestly, I was really hoping the movie would continue and we'd properly get into the Saturday Night Massacre and Nixon's downfall. The ending felt a bit sudden to me like we just picked an arbitrary point to cut off at. That's my only negative and I was most definitely left wanting more which isn't a terrible problem to have. Better than wishing something ended sooner.
