# Review

The first on our [[Blog/2024-05-28 Disney Magic Retrospective\|Disney Magic Retrospective]] and the 34th on the [[Blog/2023-11-30 AFI Top 100 List\|AFI Top 100 List]]. Alex and I were originally just going to skip Snow White because you know. We all know Snow White. It is so ingrained and foundational that I think everyone knows Snow White. But I felt with how imperial and omni-present Michael Mouse is, we would be doing a disservice to our cultural understanding by skipping it. And indeed, I did enjoy my time with Snow White. It is as simple as I recall. Evil Queen wants Snow White dead so she runs into forest, befriends dwarfs. Queen comes after her, dies, and Snow White gets reawakened by true love's kiss. A tale as old as time. What I didn't realize is that Snow White made all of the money ever and established Disney as an empire almost immediately. And I do appreciate the simplicity of it all. The plot is completely A to B to C, but with how many movies get that wrong, I enjoy when we can just land the plane.

Rather than continue watching from the List, we decided to view a couple of other Disney movies. [[Movies/Sleeping Beauty (1959)\|Sleeping Beauty]] and [[Movies/Hercules (1997)\|Hercules]].

Magic✨? There
