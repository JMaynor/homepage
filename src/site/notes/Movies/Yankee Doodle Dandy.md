# Review

I love America so much. When I saw this in the list of movies to watch, knowing nothing about it, I was bracing for impact. An ancient musical? Not on my watch. But what an unexpected joy. It was so fun. The whole movie felt a lot like a bridge between ye olde stageplays from the days of theater to the more modern style of moviemaking. Appropriate given the plot. The whole movie made me feel so patriotic and excited. I am a Yankee Doodle boy!

One small interesting fact is that there is a statue of [[People/George M. Cohan\|George M. Cohan]] in Times Square. I've probably seen it dozens if not hundreds of times in movies and TV and took no notice of it.

Also I like Over There! now, so the movie has that honor.
