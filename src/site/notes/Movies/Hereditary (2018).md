# Review

I love that they make you sit with it. Fuck. The whole stretch from the accident to...honestly a good portion into the movie where we start fucking with seances is so tightly done. We linger in scenes much longer than I think you typically would see in less confident films, but it's exactly the right amount. You just have to sit in it. That whole accident and its immediate aftermath is triumphant. I felt so tense and didn't know what to do. When I realized we weren't just going to cut away and sweep it under the rug, I was so happy. But god, it's uncomfortable.

I think the only real part of Hereditary that I didn't care for was the ending narration. I didn't need that. I would have cut right after we crowned Peter. It was clear what was happening, the narration was just putting a hat on a hat. Not bad, just a bit too much in a moment that I don't think needed it. The imagery in that scene was more than good enough to carry it.

Great acting all around. Loved the sound design. The clicks, the droning noises, things happening outside the frame. I was getting a little bit of Perverts by Ethel Cain. Pulldrone in particular. This one has some big swings and swerves. I went in largely blind. Not sure how I managed that given I was aware this was one people enjoyed, but I'm glad I did.
