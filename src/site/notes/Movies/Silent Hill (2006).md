# Review

Not great. Shocking. I fully knew what I was getting into it. I'd heard well in advance that the movie was hardly a critical darling. But I'd also heard that there were some good bits and I do quite like Silent Hill so I was curious. I desperately wanted to cut every single scene with Sean Bean. What purpose did any of it serve? It just reiterated what we had already been told. I wanted to get Pyramid Head the fuck out of there. I wanted to delete the two cutscenes we had (literally the movie stopping and having cutscenes...). There was just a menagerie of shit.

The couple bits I did enjoy. I liked the ending. Seeing that we never left Silent Hill and were stuck there. That was good and cool. I enjoyed the whole scene with the nurses in the hospital. Again, not sure why they are naughty nurses given James is nowhere to be seen...but the scene as a whole was nice and tense. The couple times where we're roaming through the empty town. Those are, as always, nice and atmospheric.

It's wild how quickly we made cults boring.
