# Review

Again, I must say, who knew Spielberg was a good director. Excellent everything all around. One of the movies that has consistently made me cry when I watch it. When Schindler breaks down as the Red Army is coming and he reflects on everything he didn't do that he could of. Even after he came to do so much. The pure humanity and empathy there. It gets me every time. There is one thing that came to mind, though, that I couldn't stop thinking about. Nothing specifically with the movie. But it scares the shit out of me that there is apparently an increasing rate of Holocaust denialism among the youth. How the fuck does that even happen and how do we fix it? I have no idea.

I genuinely feel like if anyone expressed that opinion, we as a society need to ship them off to go see the Holocaust Memorial Museum in DC. Or better yet, have them visit Auschwitz itself. I genuinely feel like that is something that we should be doing. Sometimes people can have shitty thoughts. And those thoughts don't rise to a level that they require immediate intervention. But any of this shit about denying one of the worst atrocities in human history is beyond the fold foul that I truly feel we need to immediately put a halt to what's going on in their lives and get them correct. I had the good fortune to have the opportunity to visit the DC Holocaust museum a number of years ago when I briefly lived there. It's an excellent museum, deeply affecting. Heavy and respectful. If you ever happen to have the chance to go, I would highly recommend it. But I really feel we should have some mechanism for sending people there. Not like as a complete prisoner. But something's gotta happen. Kids cannot be saying the Holocaust didn't happen. Reality is real. Truth is not just whatever you say it is. It happened. It can happen again, and it can happen anywhere if people don't stop it.
