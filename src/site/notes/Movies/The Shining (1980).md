# Review

In my opinion, The Shining is Kubrick's best work. As time has passed and I've seen more of his pictures, that's become a fierce competition. But even still, I think the Shining absolutely stands above them all. To me, it is a perfect film. I can't think of anything about it that I would change or that I could criticize.
