Rear Window was so good. Really cementing my love for [[People/Alfred Hitchcock\|Hitchcock]]'s stuff. It's just such an interesting and immediately enticing premise. A man is confined largely to an apartment and can only look out on the world outside. And what a world it is! The set is so colorful and alive. I love the little vignettes we see of each of the neighbors' little worlds. It's very akin to a stage. I know a murder happens here and everything, but it really made me want to live here. This is the future liberals want. A walkable neighborhood, praise Jesus.

Here we have another in the long line of movies I love which is small cast in a small set largely interacting with each other. There's just something about it that speaks to me on a deep level.
