# Review

I really enjoyed Skinamarink. I felt they probably could've shaved off 15-20 minutes from the beginning bits and it would've been much tighter overall. But I quite liked it. By the end, I was begging for it to be over cuz of what's happening. In particular I enjoyed the ending with the face. I had my arms pressed together, wishing for the face to go away.
