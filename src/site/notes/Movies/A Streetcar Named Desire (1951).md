# Review

I knew absolutely nothing about this going on. I had heard the name before and that is the extent. This movie was real depressing. Well-made and well-acted but so depressing. It was giving [[Movies/The Last Picture Show (1971)\|The Last Picture Show (1971)]] to me. Blanche was a fun character. Completely wacko. So crazy that, when we first met her I had no idea what the hell she was even talking about. Her first conversation where just goes on and on about 5 different topics. Hard to follow her chain of logic. But she does have a logic to her and she's an interesting character because of that. I learned apparently in the original play Stella does not leave [[People/Marlon Brando\|Marlon Brando]] at the end. And that only happened because of the censors. I'm hardly one who typically sides with the censors but...
