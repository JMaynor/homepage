# Review

Yeah, I just didn't like this one. What themes did it have that [[Movies/The Godfather Part II (1974)\|The Godfather 2]] didn't already explore? It felt like an extended expansion to Godfather 2, but everyone is way older. Also things became really unbelievable. Like, we're killing popes now? Eh...Also I'm tired of the oranges. They're in every single scene. They're in my face all the time. The version that we had watched was the updated Coda version. Which apparently was better than the theatrical version. That's great and everything, but like I said, what did we really do in this movie? If you take away the themes that we already covered in Godfather 2, what is there? Not really anything that I can remember. I did feel my attention slipping in this one big time, never ever a good thing.

Had also heard tell beforehand that Sophia Coppola's performance was widely disliked. I unfortunately must agree. It's just that she's the central character that really magnifies it. I wouldn't mind at all if she were just one of the side characters. Also why were we kissin' cousins? That felt real weird. I wasn't sure what exactly we were trying to say there.

But yeah my biggest complaint by far is the face that we're largely harping on the same exact themes we've been exploring since Godfather 1.
