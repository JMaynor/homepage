# Review

Starting to think this Billy Wilder guy might just be a good director...Very fun movie, another great addition from the 40s. And another great performance from [[People/Fred MacMurray\|Fred MacMurray]]. Last seen as Sheldrake in [[Movies/The Apartment (1960)\|The Apartment]]. Just look at that handsome fella!

We've really been on a noire kick, just coming off of [[Movies/The Maltese Falcon (1941)\|The Maltese Falcon]]. I can see how some Double Indemnity and Falcon really popularize some of these tropes that I'm sure come up again and again and again in the genre. And it's not surprising, they're great movies. Snappy, fun. They're a joy to watch. In particular, I love the lighting in this one. Specifically the lighting we get on our femme fatale Phyllis. It makes me think of a halo, or sort of an inversion of one. She looks like a saint, but we know how deadly she is. It draws my mind to the Catholic murals of the saints and angels that always had the halos of light around their heads. I'm not sure if that's specifically where the effect comes from, but that's where my mind goes.
