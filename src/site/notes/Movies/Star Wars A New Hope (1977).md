# Notes

I would say at least watch A New Hope, though the next one Empire Strikes Back is widely regarded as better in nearly every aspect and where Star Wars became Star Wars. Ignore the prequels, the sequels, the side movies, the shows. Ignore all that unless you proper get into it. Watch New Hope and if you like it watch Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Any recommendations past that can be handled afterward.
