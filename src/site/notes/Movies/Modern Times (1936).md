# Summary

Follows Chaplin as he unsuccessfully attempts to live in the modern world and be a man of industry.

# Review

I quite liked Modern Times (title still funny). I had been wanting to watch a Charlie Chaplin and it was very funny. Not subtle at all and I can see why America threw him into the sea for his thoughtcrimes. Did make me want to watch [[Movies/The Great Dictator (1940)\|The Great Dictator]] at some point. I do feel that the part-talkie was a bit weird. I think I'd rather be in full silent movie mode a la [[Movies/Sunrise (1927)\|Sunrise (1927)]] or have a talkie. The going back and forth from reading the occasional lines to just hearing someone talk was no good in my opinion. I'm sure was quite revolutionary for the time and everything, and to be clear I don't think it was egregious or anything. I'd just rather it be one or the other. I liked the men of industry.
