# Review

I think one of my favorite aspects of this film is the many little snippets of other people's stories we're seeing. There's a bunch of people that pass through the club and we only get a sentence or two out of them. But you get this sense that they have had a whole ordeal. To be expected given the war, but the world feels well-realized and lived in. [[People/Humphrey Bogart\|Humphrey Bogart]] is great here as always, love him. It's fun puzzling out what all he's about. We've seen him be such a vast array of characters over the course of the list. So coming in, he could be anything. The film itself plays with this. He continuously says he's only out for himself, but we keep getting those little moments where it really seems that isn't the case.

Renault was a standout for me. Loved that little french faggot. He was so charismatic. I'd love to see where he and Humphrey go from here. Ilsa is great as well, she gives great face. Her eyes were powerful.

Overall great film, I love stories like this.
