# Review

Oof. That was a lot. I was terrified about 30 seconds in and that feeling never really left. What was Joe's plan? What were we doin'? I don't know. I'm also not 100% certain what I'm meant to take away from that. There was a lot of mixing sex and commercialism. The sex while the TV's goin' or we see the billboards afterward. MONY. Particularly when we're going to Miami. At that point, I had my head in my hands just waiting for it to happen.

I did not care for the roving bands of Hole, Texas. They hunted up some you know what.
