# Review

Charles is a friend of mine. He is a good man. I love all his stuff. It just makes me happy. This one felt a bit like [[Movies/Modern Times (1936)\|Modern Times]] just without the depression so I can see why it's so much higher. I think I would like for us to continue having silent films with the Tramp even into the modern day. I would like, every 10 years or so, a new one inexplicably comes out into theaters. We need the Tramp and his innocent fun.
