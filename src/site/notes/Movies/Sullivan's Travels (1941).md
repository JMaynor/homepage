# Review

Strange strange movie that I feel even now I don't fully understand. I was incredibly confused with the turn from comedy to drama when movie man gets sent to the chain gang. Which, Alex and I came to believe was *the point*. "Weren't you happier when this was just a comedy?" the movie asks. But even still for some time we were openly saying, "what is happening?". I still feel that I'm missing something. Maybe it's just a cultural thing that's being lost on me. It just didn't really come across as *that* funny or great. Like not to poo-poo on it or anything. It just didn't really hit me. I quite enjoyed the scene where they throw everyone in the big shaking machine.
