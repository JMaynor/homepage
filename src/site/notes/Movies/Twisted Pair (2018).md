# Review

As I am the better man and capable of admitting when I am wrong, I wanted to publicly apologize to Neil Breen. It's very obvious to me that his initial film was a mulligan and that he needed time and also the progress of technology to better demonstrate his vision. I'm very sorry and I take back any previous words I said about him. Consider them null and void. He is an artist and he has a vision.

Twisted Pair was truly a joy to watch. I am excited to watch more Neil Breen movies in the future.
