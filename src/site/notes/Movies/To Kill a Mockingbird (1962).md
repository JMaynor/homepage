# Review

Great film, highly depressing. Didn't know what the verdict was going on, I hadn't seen it before. Though I did in fact remember that the film was named *To Kill* a Mockingbird...Once we got to Atticus' big monologue I did think for a second maybe there is hope.  He is so charismatic. And we're watching a movie. But then I recalled that this movies was based off a book and my hopes drifted away. And lo' the South continued to be the South. Sometimes Mississippi needs to burn.

I think I quite enjoy seeing depictions of the Depression era. Something about it just draws me in. No idea why. We haven't really had too many examples of it, so I'll have to interrogate that thought further as it comes up. Also, we watched this and [[Movies/Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939)\|Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]] in the same session and it was truly hilarious seeing how kids are represented in each. The incredible contrast.
