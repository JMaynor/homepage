# Review

[[People/Robert Eggers\|Eggers]] is a good man. For me he's 4 for 4. I do wish that he would stick with original screenplays. I think he just does way better when he has total control over the characters and everything. Nosferatu was purportedly a big passion project for him, something he had wanted to do for a while. So I won't hold it against him. Personally, I would rank his movies like so:

1) The Lighthouse
2) The Witch
3) Nosferatu
4) The Northman

And I do feel there's a bit of a gap between Witch and Nosferatu. Though, Nosferatu's certainly a fine film. My favorite section of the film is the leadup to the castle. There was some excellent dread-building with the little Romanian village and the carriage ride. I was feeling Cainhurst there and it did briefly make me sad, desperately desiring Bloodborne. But such is life. And then the scene next to the fireplace between Thomas and Orlok. Loved all the dialogue there. The moment we see Orlok's wide hungry eyes when Thomas cuts his hand.

Overall, I really like how we used shadow throughout the film. The many times Orlok is doing his creepo shit with the shadow of his hand passing over things. The bit where his hand is passing over the city and you just hear screams and crying.
