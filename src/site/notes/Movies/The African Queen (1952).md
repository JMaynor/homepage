# Review

I really love [[People/Katharine Hepburn\|Katharine Hepburn]]. She was such a joy to watch, deciding she is going to single-handedly take down the German African army. And [[People/Humphrey Bogart\|Humphrey Bogart]] was fun too, first time I had seen him in a picture. Real powerhouse casting those two. I realized only later after going over the Wikipedia that Katharine's brother died of fever. I was certain while watching that he simply died of English despair. It made all the sense in the world. Another thing I found hilarious after looking over the wiki entry is the whole controversy over the crazy liberalness of the movie. Two people who *aren't married* existing on a boat at the same time! Perish the thought! And I thought it was humorous when they were doing the bathing scene, terrified of the other seeing them. Despite the fact that they are both clearly fully clothed. God bless the march of time. I did overall quite like the movie. I can see its influence on other similar adventure movies.
