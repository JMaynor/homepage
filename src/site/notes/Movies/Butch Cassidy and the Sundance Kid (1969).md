# Review

Wow, I was kind of dreading another western, but I really enjoyed it. I would definitely put it at the top of the ones I've seen. And I think it made me realize one of the primary reasons I haven't enjoyed others so much. It's all about the main characters. I think in most westerns I've been very cool on the main protag/protags. Either they've been unlikeable in some way (most of the crew of [[Movies/The Wild Bunch (1969)\|The Wild Bunch (1969)]]), or they're just mostly flat (think the classical western stoic man stuff). But [[People/Robert Redford\|Robert Redford]] and [[People/Paul Newman\|Paul Newman]] were a joy to watch together. The movie was very funny and the two main leads were both really charismatic and also had a great chemistry together. It was totally believable that they were good friends and it made the movie way more investing than other westerns. To me, at least. To anyone who is also not hot on the genre, very good one that I think you would like.
