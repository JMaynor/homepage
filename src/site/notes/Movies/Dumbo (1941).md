# Review

I like the rubber animation. Don't know the name of that style but it was very present in Cuphead and I really like it. Maybe it's just because it makes me think of cartoons that existed when I was a kid that don't really seem to exist as much nowadays. And so it's an immediate sign of oldness. But I just really like how fluid and dynamic it looks. I did feel magic watching Dumbo and his mother interact. Very warm, I can feel the love.

Also completely random little thing, but I love when we see the really stylized world or country maps in cartoons and such. The couple times we see the circus train traveling through Florida. I like seeing the little local oddities that people feel get to make it onto the map. I just really like maps.

Magicâœ¨? There
