# Review

No good. Like, ok, this was technically a good movie. In the technical sense. The action was actioning. The actors were acting. But Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, the racism was extreme. It completely took us out of the movie as we were watching it. I do not have any desire to watch any more John Wayne movies. I do not enjoy watching Injun Joe and Salts-the-Earth be the bad guys. It just feels so nasty. Our big emotional climax/revelation in this film is when John Wayne accepts a girl who's skin is white as snow perhaps possibly hasn't been irreversibly tainted by the Comanche. God...

This was everything I feared from the cowboy films and I do not want more. We pretty universally agreed that kicking John Wayne entirely off the list was not the way. It would be a glaring omission. But we're absolutely kicking him down into like at least the 40s or 50s, if this is what he has for us.
