# Review

Mostly a meh for me. It felt sort of empty, I wasn't really sure what we were doing. I suppose that is in fact the point, the pointlessness of Vietnam shown through Korea. But the comparisons to [[Movies/Nashville (1975)\|Nashville (1975)]] were present and I have to say, I much preferred Nashville. It felt so much more meaningful to me. I wouldn't say that M\*A\*S\*H was bad at all. It was firmly in the fine camp. Also, I really did not like what was going on with the women characters. It was wild how mean to them we were and how they were seemingly universally portrayed as dunces. It got genuinely uncomfortable. I'm very uncertain on whether that was just the point or not. It's what I want to assume, but if so I'm not sure what to take away from it. That the women are presented how the men see them? Perhaps. Again, I feel like I was missing something in this movie. Perhaps the point is the listlessness, but I feel that just makes for a bad watching experience.

More than a lot of other movies on the list, I think I'll be reading into other people's thoughts, because I really feel like I missed something.
