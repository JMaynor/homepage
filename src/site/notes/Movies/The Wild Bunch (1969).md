# Review

It's fine or whatever. There's just something about Westerns that do not capture my imagination. I don't hold it against them personally. I've just never felt particularly drawn to them. Maybe if there were a particularly weirdo atypical dreamy one. Something for me to grab onto. But yeah this one was fine I guess, it did get particularly bloody. I did kind of find myself liking the protags by the end of the movie (just in time for the whole everything that happens) even though they were mostly all terrible. One was fully a gremlin. I liked the laughing theme. Seeing em all laugh at the end after the stuff with Generalissimo.
