# Review

Hitchcock is fucking great. Another I've seen several times before so not too many thoughts. It is still quite clever. The switch from following Marion to Norman. I can't think of any other examples where a film has done that. And I think for good reason. It could so easily go poorly. If Marion's story isn't interesting enough, then all people would think is how it's taking up space and would have been better to just follow Norman from the start. But if the rest of the film wasn't great then it would just go the other way. Where people would be more interested in the noire money-stealing plot and be disappointed when Mother decides Marion needs to go. It's a tight line, but Hitchcock is more than capable of doing it. I think I'd like to see more examples of it being done well. It's just a really interesting narrative structure to me.
