# Review

Does make me want to do a [[People/Martin Scorsese\|Scorsese]] deep dive. I've really enjoyed every movie of his I've watched but have never done all of them. I had seen Taxi Driver before and so I knew it to be quite good. One particular component is the almost sinister calming music that brings us back down in between scenes. It puts you back at ease before we see Travis doing or saying some other insane nonsense at out destination. [[People/Jodie Foster\|Jodie Foster]]'s acting in particular was wildly good. Reminded me a bit of [[People/Kirsten Dunst\|Kirsten Dunst]]'s performance in [[Movies/Interview with the Vampire (1994)\|Interview with the Vampire]]. A child actor managing to in some cases surpass the adults in the room. It's very obvious watching Foster here the trajectory that she will have.

One completely random thing I wanted to call out is near the end of the movie when Travis has hit his limit and it is happening. There is a moment in the apartment building where a man walks out of a pitch black dark hallway toward the camera. It was so Lynchian I nearly screamed. His visuals are so powerful. I know this is a Scorsese, but those couple seconds I felt Lynch in the room with me.

Something Alex mentioned while we were watching that I think is good enough to repeat is that Taxi Driver should really be required viewing in schools. It really shows you all the signs of a school shooter. Would be good for people to be better at recognizing that.
