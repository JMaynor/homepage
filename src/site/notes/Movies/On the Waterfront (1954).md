# Review

Waterfront was great, much better than [[Movies/It’s a Wonderful Life (1946)\|It’s a Wonderful Life]]. There were a couple instances where we thought the music was going a bit crazy. More than the actual events of the scene necessitated. Felt a bit like producer decisions. But in general, this was really well-acted. [[People/Marlon Brando\|Marlon Brando]] gives a captivating performance. He didn't scare me like he has been in the other movies on this list...I mean he was great as Vito in [[Movies/The Godfather (1972)\|The Godfather]]. But pretty much everything else he's been a monster. In Waterfront, we get some nice fun crime stuff mixed with slow drama. Felt a bit like a mix between Rocky and Tony Soprano. I definitely felt [[People/James Gandolfini\|James Gandolfini]] might've been channeling a bit of Terry Malloy.

I'm very glad I didn't get Streetcar'd. I felt some darkness there around the 2/3 point of the film. I was really fearing everything was gonna go around. But we got some nice comeuppance and martyrdom. The Catholics would be proud.
