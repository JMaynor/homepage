# Review

Absolutely spectacular. Fucking goddamn cinema. I love cinema. I love it. So the cinematography was insane. I have grown to absolutely loathe all CGI. It's garbage and it's trash and we don't need it. You wanna film something on an alien world? Go get on your spaceship and you go there, ok? Some of the scenes in this one nearly did look like an alien world. The blues were blueing. I have never in my life seen water so blue and delicious. I wanted to go right up to that ocean water, drink deep, and descend.

Lawrence himself is an arresting performance. I couldn't take my eyes off of him. But even then, literally every actor is bringing their A game. Every character we get a good look at is a pleasure to watch. Sherif Kharish was a particularly great character. I really love that the first time we meet him, he's this asshole that kills what had, up until that point, been quite a nice guide character we were getting to like. And by the end of the film we are brothers.

I love the historical epic. I want more of them and I want to go see them in the theaters. I know that they cost money. I know that they can go tits-up. I don't care, because when they are done well, they completely sweep me away.
