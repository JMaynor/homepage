# Review

This movie was so funny! Funnier than most any older movie I can recall watching. I really enjoyed [[People/Katharine Hepburn\|Katharine Hepburn]]'s performance in particular. I loved how powerful she was. [[People/Cary Grant\|Cary Grant]] was also very good. It felt very similar to Airplane! to me. Where it's just a joke coming every couple seconds.
