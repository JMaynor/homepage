# Review

I liked the Persians. The America song in particular. I'm always a fan of call-and-response style songs. The children were insufferable to watch. I know that the movie is just a retelling of Romeo & Juliet, but "modern". But like...they are annoying in Romeo & Juliet as well...Why are we fighting? Because the white people have the best playground and aren't willing to share with their fellow Shoe-Polish Americans? Disgraceful.

The movie was so goddamn long. Multiple times I was checking the runtime and that is always a very bad sign. I thought surely we were gettin into the third act and it was only like 30 minutes in. This did have all the trappings of a musical I don't like. It was funny I guess, but not really in an intended way. More we were laughing at the insanity being displayed in front of us. I think I would have just turned the movie off and watched something else if I had been watching it on my own.

It didn't measure up to any of the other musicals we've done thus far. Once again, why in the fuck was [[Movies/Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942)\|Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942)]] so low? Particularly in comparison to this. I'll grant [[Movies/The Sound of Music (1965)\|The Sound of Music (1965)]] it's higher spot, it's definitely more notable. But how is West Side Story higher than Yankee Doodle? And so notable higher? I dunno. I hope we don't have any more of this. I strongly believe this was a [[Movies/Swing Time (1936)\|Swing Time (1936)]] that got in on fame rather than actual merit. This really started souring me on musicals again. Please, more Yankee Doodle. More [[Movies/Cabaret (1972)\|Cabaret (1972)]].
