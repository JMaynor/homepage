Great stuff. I have to say, I'd really like to see some more Lovecraft stuff in the silent film format. It's an excellent medium. Feels appropriately pulpy. And additionally, I have a big appetite for 50 minutes films. I've said previously that I really think the majority of films should probably be 90 minutes at most. And that to be longer, you gotta jump through hoops and get special permission, demonstrating why you *need* to be longer. But a nice little 50 minute snack is delectable. We get in, do our thing, and immediately move on.

R'lyeh is the obvious star of the show here. And it is decidedly well-done. Love the weird angles. Lots of camera trickery going on. We repeatedly find ourselves at the top of impossibly large cliffs after seemingly only going up a small ledge. There's that moment where one of the poor sailor fellas falls into a wrong angle. It looks great.

Lots of love was on display here and I think the medium really lended itself to the material.
