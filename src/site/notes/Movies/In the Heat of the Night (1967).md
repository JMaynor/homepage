# Review

I want Antebellum to burn. I'm tired of seeing it in these movies. It is never any good and it's getting very tiring. I wanted Mississippi to burn. And it didn't. The movie itself was fine. I feel like I'm missing something though. It didn't really seem like it was super notable to me. Like it was good and everything, it just didn't really blow me away. My assumption is perhaps it went on to inspire other detective-y crime-y movies and I'm just feeling the Seinfeld effect where some people no longer find the original funny/notable. That's my best guess at least.
