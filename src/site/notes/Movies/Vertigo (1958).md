# Review

Some excellent Hitchcock here. I loved the use of color also. Obviously not something we've seen in the previous Hitchcock's so he made use of it really well. The greens in the hotel. The softer blues of the ocean and sky in the outside scenes. It really stood out. I will say that at one point Tyler, Alex, and myself screamed out loud "What?! What! Excuse me?!". Hitchcock did that. When we meet the other Madeleine and see the flashback with both in the tower. Screaming. It was immediately brought to heel as she sits down and writes out a letter explaining everything. The 50s people were NOT ready. There would have been riots, I am sure. We're not yet ready for the Lynchian times where that would have happened and we would have confidently charged ahead leaving you to figure it out for yourself. I would have liked that personally, but I understand why we didn't do that.

Also something else I loved was the scary inversion of [[People/James Stewart\|James Stewart]]. He's our nice American man and we made him terrifying. Excellent directing given to him that only works because of the many prior performances we've seen from him.
