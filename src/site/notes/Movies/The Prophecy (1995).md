# Review

A fun movie. It wasn't good, but [[People/Christopher Walken\|Christopher Walken]]'s performance kinda carried it. There was one moment that made me laugh out loud so hard. It's when Gabriel is outside the Native Americans' house and doubting Thomas tells schoolteacher to go inside. He says something along the lines of "and make sure to lock the door". It is visibly like this wooden shanty door. Closer to the type of door you'd see in an old-timey saloon. There is absolutely no lock on this door. It sounded like an ad-lib that they just forgot to take out. Made me laugh.
