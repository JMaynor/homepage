 > Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown.

A great film, of course. I had seen Chinatown once or twice before so I was already largely familiar with it. On this viewing, however, I did have more of an appreciation for the noire films Chinatown was channeling. We'd viewed several on this list. And it was really interesting seeing those older films being viewed from the lens of newer cinematography. One example being the "femme fatale" lighting we see repeatedly on [[People/Faye Dunaway\|Faye Dunaway]]. Much like the last time I spoke of it with [[Movies/Double Indemnity (1944)\|Double Indemnity]].

The film also is another notch in the belt of "the 70s were he best era of films". Well, perhaps I won't say best. My favorite, if nothing else. I like when directors are allowed to be directors. Moving swiftly past Polanski himself, obviously...

I need to do a deep dive on [[People/Jack Nicholson\|Jack Nicholson]]. I've seen so few films of him, but every one I've really loved.
