# Review

My first Marx brothers movie. I was vaguely aware of them, but wasn't particularly familiar with any of their work. I thought the movie was fine. There was funny bits. The whole stateroom scene was the standout. I thought Groucho Marx's character was far and away the funniest part of the movie. Harpo frightened me to my core, his eyes had ill intent. Chico was present. Overall, it seemed a bit saccharine at times, the scene where they're playing music for the kids. Not quite a miss, but wasn't as good as some of the other particularly old movies from the list.
