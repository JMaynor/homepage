# Review

My favorite Eggers movie and one of my fave horror(?)s in general. What genre even is this movie? Is it scary? Kinda but not really. Is it a thriller? Kinda but not really. Is it a drama? Kinda but not really. A semi-allegorical tale of Prometheus interwoven with various sea myths held together by the knockout acting from [[People/Willem Dafoe\|Willem Dafoe]] and [[People/Robert Pattinson\|Robert Pattinson]]? Just about.

I would describe the Lighthouse as one of my comfort movies. I've watched it 4 or so times. And it's just so many things that I like in a small package that it pleases me to see it. I'm a big fan of small sets and a few characters with big drama. (See [[Movies/12 Angry Men (1957)\|12 Angry Men (1957)]] or [[Movies/Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (1966)\|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (1966)]]) Perhaps I'm shockingly out of touch with the common man that I would describe the Lighthouse as a comfort movie, but I just feel so comforted by it, you know? It's so good and so tight. It's exactly what it needs to be, no detail is superfluous. But it's not so wacko in the clouds that it doesn't continue to function on just a base level. If you take everything that's happening as largely true.

I enjoyed the Northman, but Lighthouse is still top tier for me and I'm hoping that future Eggers movies continue in this direction.
