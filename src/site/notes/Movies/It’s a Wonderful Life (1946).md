# Review

This was way too high up the list. I had never seen this one before. I know it's like a Christmas classic or whatever. But to me this was a strong 80 at best. In particular, I greatly disliked how long the whole other universe sequence went on. They made Jimmy look like a total goon. It was weird. Technically fine and everything. I enjoyed most of the film. But I felt it did not stick the landing. They really seemed to think the audience was stupid. Jimmy not understanding what's happened and repeatedly asking everyone where he is and what color the sky is. Very silly. It's an ok life.
