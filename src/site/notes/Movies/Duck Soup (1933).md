# Review

Lovely fun time. Liked it a lot more than [[Movies/A Night at the Opera (1935)\|A Night at the Opera (1935)]]. I did like Opera, but I felt it got overly saccharine a number of times. This one was just the Marx brothers comedy without any of the whatever bits. Harpo still scares me to my core. Why is it called Duck Soup?
