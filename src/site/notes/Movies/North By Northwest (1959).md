# Review

Had a lot of fun with this one. I was very excited for our first [[People/Alfred Hitchcock\|Hitchcock]]. Prior to this, I've actually only seen Psycho, of his works. Even though I'm certain I really like him. And I was right! He is in fact the master of suspense, numerous times he had me on the edge of my seat. And multiple times I said "Oh wow, that's a good shot." ([[People/Cary Grant\|Cary Grant]] walking out of the building as an example) I also really enjoyed Cary Grant's character, the fact that he's pretty quick-witted and just sort of goes along on the ridiculous ride. Afterward, my assumption being he just joins the CIA as an agent. Already showed himself to be pretty capable. Overall, very good. Great performances, funny  and exciting, some lovely shots. Great first foray into Hitchcock for this list.
