# Review

Love Rocky, he is my favorite sportsball man. The movie did feel somewhat incomplete, without the rest of the series. There were a number of times I was thinking of something I liked and realized it was in one of the next ones. But the first is still a good standalone with a complete A to B story. I think one of Rocky's biggest strengths is how simple it is. We're not working with much depth, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. We've basically got like 5 characters (Rocky, Adrian, Paulie, Mickey, and Apollo) and much of the movie is simply the drama in seeing them interact. I do greatly enjoy the extreme Americana that comes later in the series as Rocky becomes the American hero we know him to be, but I enjoyed his humble beginnings. Loved the long shots of him simply walking through his neighborhood as some somber, but not dour, music plays.
