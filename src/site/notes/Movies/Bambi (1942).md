# Review

Bambi is so adorable. I love the animation on him in particular, them long gangly legs. He's so cute. I know that I said before that I really liked the [[Movies/Dumbo (1941)\|Dumbo (1941)]] rubber animation and that's still true, but it was also nice seeing what felt like the first proper Disney animation movie.

And look, I'm not saying that all hunters are bad...I'm just saying that if you saw Bambi at a very young age and then still decided to become a hunter later on, I think you've got a couple screws loose. I do really like how they are a completely unseen (but forever present after their introduction) threat. Very effective. I did still get sad when Bambi's mom is shot.

Magicâœ¨? There
