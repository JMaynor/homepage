# Review

I see you [[Games/Call of Duty Black Ops (2010)\|Call of Duty Black Ops (2010)]].

Love the 70s, love them so much. Such a great movie. As the prologue went on at first I almost felt a tinge of desire to get to the Nam bits that I knew were coming. But God do I wish we could go back to those halcyon days before the war. [[People/Robert De Niro\|De Niro]] was definitely the correct person for this role. Was beyond depressing seeing what happened between him and [[People/Christopher Walken\|Christopher Walken]]. But that's Nam for ya I guess. I eagerly await when we don't have real depresso movie from that setting...
