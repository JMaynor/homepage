# Review

Good to see that Al Capone is doing well with his life after the whole business in Chicago. Obviously the most notable thing here is the one take. It's very well done and contributes a lot to the oppressing stress in this kitchen. Nothing in particular is happening all the time, but the constant moving from character to character hearing snippets of their lives becomes exhausting (in a good way). Everyone's got their own thing going on.

I'm aware that they made a sequel little miniseries to this film. That seems like an odd idea to me. I do get the sense that we had a lot going well in the film, production-wise. So I can understand wanting to expand and capitalize on it. But it seems unneeded to me. I love the little self-contained story here. Not poo-pooing it, because I have not seen it. Just not something that I really needed.
