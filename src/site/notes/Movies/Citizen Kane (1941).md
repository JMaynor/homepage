# Review

The great and powerful pasha of cinema. The grandaddy of them all. I had not seen Kane before and I'm really glad that I hadn't. I wish I didn't already know what Rosebud was, but I mean that well and truly in the cultural zeitgeist. The reason I'm glad I had not watched the film previously is the List really prepared me to appreciate everything this film is doing. I can just see a younger me watching this, thinking it's good, and moving on. But it really is ahead of it's time. It's hard to see that, though if you haven't got the foreknowledge of the films that have come before. The angles and the transitions are perfectly modern. But you have to have seen the static stageplays to see how big of a difference that is. 1941! Very impressive.

[[People/Orson Welles\|Orson Welles]] is arresting to watch. The picture the film paints has so much depth. You really get to know him. It's a joy, particularly with the knowledge that he's also directing and producing. The man had a vision and I was happy to see it.

Well, this was great and the List has ruined me.
