# Review

Really enjoyed this. Continuing the string of movies about the Depression that I've really liked. Once again, FDR saves America. It is a well-explored tradition, seemingly. The communism was strong in this. We had read that this one was lambasted as being commie propaganda. At first I rolled my eyes, because you know, they called fuckin everything communism back in the day. But as the movie went along, it became extremely pronounced. We were about to get our sickles and hammers out. So I can totally see it. This movie did teach me that state governments are shit and horrible and the federal government (FDR specifically) are golden saviors who are gonna come to us in our dusty tombs and take us to Eden.

Also, loved the land yacht.
