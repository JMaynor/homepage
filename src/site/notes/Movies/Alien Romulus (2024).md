# Review

It didn't offend me. I didn't hate it. I don't go into Alien movies these days with much hope or life in my limbs. I've got low expectations. After the horror of [[Blog/2023-08-14 AvP Retrospective#Alien Resurrection (1997)\|Alien Resurrection]], they have very little power over me. The sheer depression and revulsion after seeing the schlock of Resurrection has become a permanent vaccine against many ills of the world.

I think the most depressing thing is that it genuinely begins really good. Everything on the colony world place was great. It was really interesting seeing the Weyland-Yutani mining world. Horrible place, as one would expect, and I was genuinely interested to see more of it. Which is why it's so disappointing that, once we get out into space it really just goes completely by-the-numbers Alien movie. To the point where you can see every twist and turn coming. No real surprise. There was a couple of notably examples where I actually thought they did something inventive, but it was by and large "Alright we're in kill mode now. You're dead, now you're dead, now you're dead." The zero G acid blood scene is the one that most comes to mind. Good stuff, wouldn't have thought of that. The heated room scene also to a slightly lesser extent.

Wasn't expecting a return of the newborn, that was fully Orphan of Kos. Bloodborne 2 baybee! It's design got a laugh in my theater which was a bit disappointing. I thought it was fairly wretched in a uncanny valley. But purposefully wretched such that I wanted to look away from it. And speaking of uncanny valley, Ash! That was garbage CGI and I hated it. Exactly as bad as Tarkin, I don't know why we needed to do that. I would have been fine if he was just on the screens, but he was horrible in person. I don't know why they didn't just fuck with his face or something. It would have been so easy to have half of it torn off or something. Something that makes you look at him, but not so closely at the CGI. That we put him in a bright room in the center of the camera was wild. Choices! i demand we stop doing this shit.

Android man was best character by far. Genuinely good acting with some subtleties. You can see him doing the math of shall I push these fools into the oncoming trolley or no. Androids are not friends.
