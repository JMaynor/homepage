# Review

"Whyn't we try an' hunt up some pussy?" - phrase that has haunted me ever since I watched Last Picture Show

I fucking hate this movie so much. I mean, don't get me wrong, it is a good movie. And I totally get what it's doing. But god is it depressing. Alex and I agreed that it very much feels like a David Lynch world that had all of the whimsy and joy sucked out of it. Hole, Texas is a wretched place I never wanna see again. It's just so dour with nothing uplifiting in it. It's a hole that sucks you in and you never get out of. Also who on God's green earth is watching this? I had never heard of this before and I strongly believe that the only people watching it are those going through the List.
