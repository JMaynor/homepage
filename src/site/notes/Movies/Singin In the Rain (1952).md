# Review

I don't think I've ever much cared for movies that are clearly just *about* Hollywood. I find that the plot always feels like an afterthought. Which is definitely the case here. What all really *happens* during Singin in the Rain? Not all that much. We got a job doing some acting. Then we do a little bit of acting. I think my biggest frustration with such movies where they're about Hollywood, is that Hollywood itself always adores them beyond all reason. Even though I really don't think they're that great. The biggest point of comparison I have is Hail Caesar by the Cohens. I greatly disliked that one and felt like I had been lied to since the trailer made it seem like it was gonna be some sort of silly heist thing. But it was just about Hollywood.

I will say, I greatly enjoyed the effects we had going on here. We fully started flying at the camera while dancing. It was very impressive. The standout visual for me was when [[People/Gene Kelly\|Gene Kelly]] is dancing with the woman with the very large piece of fabric that they've got waving in the wind. It was quite impressive. All of the dancing was very good, actually.

I also enjoyed the sort of menage e trois we had going on between Don, Cosmo, and Kathy. There was a bit we were dancing around a house and ended up on an overturned couch and I was wondering, "Did we just have sex?" They were all pretty charismatic.
