# Review

It's good! I can't begin to explain the fear I had going in. But it did the thing that I felt was monumentally important to get right which is being quick. It's not *as* quick as the old movies. There are some lulls, but it's got the right sense of humor. It doesn't feel like a standard modern comedy. I don't feel like I'm watching some alien try to imitate human behavior. Liam Nelson was a fine choice as our lead. He does well as Frank Drebin Jr. I would enjoy seeing more.
