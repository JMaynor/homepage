# Review

Quite good. Similar theming tonight with [[Movies/Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)\|Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)]] with the whole outlawism not being so bad. I'm curious what dear Stephen thinks of this rendition of his stuff. Still haven't read any King books, but I've enjoyed most of the adaptations of his works.
