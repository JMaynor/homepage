# Review

Fun, though I did enjoy [[Movies/Bringing Up Baby (1938)\|Bringing Up Baby (1938)]] more. I really do love [[People/Katharine Hepburn\|Katharine Hepburn]]. She's quickly become my favorite actress from this era. How could you not love her? And with the knowledge that hse Katharine Hepburned at [[People/Howard Hughes\|Howard Hughes]] to make the movie happen makes it all the better. The dialogue was particularly enjoyable. I love the witty back-and-forth. A little subgenre I'm a big fan of. I like when it feels like everyone is at the top of their game.
