# Review

Stressful as hell. I just wanted someone to do the right thing. But no one would. But what even *is* the right thing? The moment the cops showed up my heart dropped because you can't live in the world we do and not see exactly what's about to happen. Not remotely shocking, even if it should be. The way they used heat reminded me of how it's used in [[Movies/12 Angry Men (1957)\|12 Angry Men (1957)]].

I really liked the color and cinematography. Brooklyn felt so alive with the camera angles, the sort of interview-style filming. It invited me into the place that the movie was showing.
