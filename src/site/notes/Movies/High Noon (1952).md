# Review

This was good. I would put it in the same camp of [[Movies/Shane (1953)\|Shane]] where it was never gonna blow me away, but it didn't offend me. There were some good shots as well. There was the famous one that I knew of prior to watching, where main man is standing all alone on the city street. This town is shit. Leave them far behind, main man whose name escapes me, they can do nothing for themselves. Also nice to see [[People/Grace Kelly\|Grace Kelly]], though this was so early. She got 1,000 times more to do in [[Movies/Rear Window (1954)\|Rear Window]]. So that was a little disappointing. I mean I get the story's not really about her. I did like that one scene where she and main man meet up after their disagreement. Both happy, thinking that the other one has changed their minds about staying/leaving. That was funny.
