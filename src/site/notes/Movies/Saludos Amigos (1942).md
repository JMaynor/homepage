# Review

I like when we learn about other cultures. It's fun! This one was different, obviously. Not quite one of the full animated movies and more just a collection of shorts. I mostly liked them. The planes I could take or leave. I enjoyed our official introduction to Donald Duck. That's fun. Such humble beginnings. Crazy he starts here and ends up saving the world from the seekers of darkness. Good on him. And Goofy was here too.

I think the last short where we learn how to samba was clearly the best. I could feel a little bit of that [[Movies/Fantasia (1940)\|Fantasia]] energy. Also enjoyed all the interstitial map bits. Love seeing the heavily stylized countries. Always feels nostalgic. Probably for the best then that we stayed in the Americas with those, given what year it is...Storm clouds gather over Europe.

Magic✨? There
