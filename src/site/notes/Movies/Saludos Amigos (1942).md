# Review

I like when we learn about other cultures. It's fun! This one was different, obviously. Not quite one of the full animated movies and more just a collection of shorts. I mostly liked them. The planes I could take or leave. I enjoyed our officially introduction to Donald Duck. That's fun. Such humble beginnings. Crazy he starts here and ends up saving the world from the seekers of darkness. Good on him.

I think the last short where we learn how to samba was clearly the best. I could feel a little bit of that [[Movies/Fantasia (1940)\|Fantasia]] energy. Also enjoyed all the interstitial map bits. Love seeing the heavily stylized countries. Always feels nostalgic. Probably for the best we stayed in the Americas, given what year it is...

Magic✨? There
