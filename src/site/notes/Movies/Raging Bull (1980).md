# Review

I just wish people could keep their eyes to themselves and also stop insisting on cheating on their spouses. I do enjoy the troubled protagonist, though. Always more interesting to watch than some goodie-two-shoes. Definitely one of the better biopics I've seen. Even though that's not typically a genre I go for. I do like when the movie is more character-driver, but I also prefer having the freedom to tell whatever story we like.

Was definitely a good movie, but I think I prefer some of Scorsese's other works such as [[Movies/Goodfellas (1990)\|Goodfellas]] or [[Movies/Taxi Driver (1976)\|Taxi Driver]]. One big standout scene was that last fight with Sugar Ray Robinson. When everything goes really quiet at the end and Sugar Ray is coming down on Jake like the hand of God. Great stuff, particularly with the otherworldly noises going on.
