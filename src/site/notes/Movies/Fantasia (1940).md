# Review

Fantasia could not have been made today. This feels like such a risky thing to create that I just can't see Disney ever doing something like this again. It feels barely possible in 2000 much less 2024. This took real thought. This was an idea. This was "I've got an idea for something and I wanna bring it into the world". This is hope.

How magical it is. Literally just a direct translation of music to animation. Something so simple and human rendered into a visual medium for the enjoyment of all. Beautiful.

Magic✨? There
