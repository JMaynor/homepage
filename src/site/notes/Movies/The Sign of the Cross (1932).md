# Review

"They were covered in pitch and burned as torches to light Nero's orgies." Oh, Rome...

Very good and fun. I love the historical epic so much. The green screens must go. Every epic I've  seen has been yet another nail in their coffin. My first Cecil B. DeMille. I have to say, the Christian message is rather a lot stronger when you are actually being persecuted. The scene where everyone is marching up the stairs into the arena to their deaths while singing genuinely had me tearing up. The modern Christian persecution complex is so disgusting. I saw a gay on Facebook, so that means I'm a victim that deserves the world. It's truly an embarrassment.

Strong performances all around. I think I'd play Nero in the remake. He was simply too fun. I had thought I recognized [[People/Claudette Colbert\|Claudette Colbert]] as our Roman Empress. She was the female lead in [[Movies/It Happened One Night (1934)\|It Happened One Night]]. She was definitely given a lot more to do here. Loved her as the wretched temptress. Very powerful, "Marcus, don't make me command you to love me." I mean at one point she's bathing in a pool of fresh milk and petals. All the Roman decadence was very well done.

I felt the resolution with Marcus did come a little bit suddenly, I thought there could've been a little bit more there. Just like one missing scene to cement his turn, I think. My only real complaint. Otherwise it was nice and tight. Also I love intermissions and demand we return them. This movie was fully only two hours and still we got an intermission. Movies need piss and water breaks, okay. Was originally going to watch the Ten Commandments, but saw it was 4 hours. So that's a story for another time.
