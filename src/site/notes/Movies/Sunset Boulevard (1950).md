# Review

I really love Billy. His movies are just so good. Norma really stole the show here. We saw her and immediately knew that she was powerful. In the [[People/Katharine Hepburn\|Katharine Hepburn]] way of being immediately magnetic the moment they walk on screen. I mean, the woman's bed is a viking boat that will take her to Valhalla.

That last scene was particularly fantastic. Norma being so happy to be seen by her cameras again. And then she did a Lynch at the very end and came right for us in the audience. Truly she is terrifying. I was getting some Mulholland Drive vibes from the movie. I wonder if perhaps this film was an influence for Lynch? I could see it if so.
