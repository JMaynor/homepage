# Review

Very strange movie I'm unsure how to feel about. It was funny, certainly. But also...so dark. There's so many instances of some silly little comedy bit happening and in the background you just see stormtroopers harassing someone or Juden painted on a shop window. It's so dark, and made even more so given this is being made in the late 30s. The War hasn't even begun to start at all. Led to me feeling weird while watching. Definitely enjoyable and glad I watched it, but still. I did find myself enjoying big chin-o. Quaint that the movie paints him as the one calling any of the shots. But fun watching the big Italian man boss around mustachio. I think in general I prefer the silent era [[People/Charlie Chaplin\|Charlie Chaplin]] films. But this was obviously important and I enjoyed my time with it.
