# Review

Normally I would not have particularly cared for Shane. But I was really primed to be fine with a western after the several real depressing movies we've had in a row. And it was indeed fine. The landscapes in particular were gorgeous and a clear standout of the film for me. America is beautiful indeed. In fact, Shane has inspired me to make a grand proclamation unto Hollywood. Woe to those that do not heed it. I have decided that what we're gonna do is we will have one of the big blue/green rooms in Hollywood. And what we'll do is only one movie in a year is allowed to use the big blue/green room. They must fight each other over it for the privilege. All other films must be shot in the real world. The green screen has been abused beyond recognition with filmmakers putting in no thought as to how a scene could be shot with any actual cinematography. Rather than being a tool to occasionally allow us to glimpse vast vistas well beyond the impossible, it's instead used as a crutch. I can't stand the flat uninspired movies that get churned out of the blue/green rooms. So they're going away. But as I said, I am a kind and considerate emperor and so I will gift to the world one last blue/green room. And it will be used on a maximum of 1 movie in a year. (By using the blue/green room, those become classified as movies and not films.)

But back to Shane. I quite liked that there ended up being comparatively little rooting and tooting and cowboy shooting. It was nice to mostly just have characters interacting. Alex and I both agreed that Shane exuded Bethesda protagonist energy. One who is seemingly taking a break from the main quest to piss about doing some random whatever before getting back to the ol' dusty trail. I thought that was an interesting setup. Having someone who exudes an aura of "I could really easily deal with this whole thing, but look I'm on vacation okay."
