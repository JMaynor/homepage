# Review

I think I definitely preferred [[Movies/The Godfather (1972)\|The Godfather]] to 2. I definitely liked 2, but it felt like it crossed a point to me where it was just too long, too many layers. A bit too much to keep up with. Excellent acting from everyone, and on subsequent viewings, now that I get everything that's going on, I might have a warmer reception to it. But for now, I like the relative simplicity of the first movie's story. I also felt like I could see where this one was going like 5 minutes into the movie. So while it was generally satisfying seeing it get there (again, everyone's at the top of their game), it did leave me a bit tired. Michael is bastard and pushing everyone important away from him. He has all the money and power in the world and gets no real enjoyment from it. A tragedy. Obviously intentional, but still.

Anyway, on to [[Movies/The Godfather Part III (1990)\|Godfather 3]]
