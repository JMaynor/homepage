# Review

Had never heard of this one. I was really surprised by how good the acting was. Everyone acted like actual people. Multiple times I was expecting things to blow up and be overly dramatic and people surprised me by being reasonable. The conversation between Peggy and her parents. The conversation between Fred and Al. Both times people just sat down and spoke to each other like people. It was amazing, particularly given when this movie was made. Feels like it would have been all too easy for people to act crazy and over the top.
