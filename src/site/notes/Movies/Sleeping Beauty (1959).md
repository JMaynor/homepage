# Review

Skipping ahead a bit here. I watched this one right after [[Movies/Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)\|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]. And coincidently it very much felt like a newer version of Snow White. I enjoyed that the animation was properly what I think of as Disney. Also, random detail but the forests in particular I liked how they were animated. The weirdo geometric shapes and the sheer cliffs and bluffs.

Sleeping Beauty was really good overall. I felt it could have used a bit more length. This was like barely over an hour. The 3 good fairies were the clear highlight. I went in wanting to see Malificent, but I had completely forgotten how charismatic the fairies were. Loved their silly arguing. Malifecent though was also very enjoyable. I love that the mistress of all evil does just seem to like fucking with this kingdom for no reason in particular. Not working towards any goal or anything. Just very "I Wanna Be Evil".

Magic✨? There
