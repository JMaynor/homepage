# Review

I enjoyed it in general. The cinematography was wild good. I feel the screenplay could've used some work. I think it could've been maybe 20-30 minutes longer. Some great dread-building. I didn't like once the mom started explaining the whole situation to me. Would rather have filled in some of the blanks myself. Prior to seeing the movie I had heard some comparisons to Twin Peaks. That did color my perceptions a bit. I was hoping for a bit more of that surrealism.
