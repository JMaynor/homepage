# Review

I found my self on the defense for this one. Similar to with [[Movies/Nashville (1975)\|Nashville]]. And in fact, there was a lot of Nashville energy in this one. Alex wasn't having it nearly as much as I was. But I think this movie is wildly ahead of its time. It's dark, very dark. I mean at one point, when it got to its worst we literally had gangsters running children off the road. Those kids are dead! These are 30s cars! That was really wild. But I felt for Mr. Smith. Once again, a great performance from [[People/James Stewart\|James Stewart]]. He might just be a pretty good actor. I do feel the movie was a little bit off with its pacing. We fly by in the beginning and then all of a sudden are having the long extended bits in Congress. I could see a more lithe movie being pretty interesting. Where it's very focused on just the filibuster. We thought this was a good example of a place where a remake could be really good. I mean, it can't because Hollywood is shit and can't make good remakes. But like in a different world a modern remake of Mr. Smith I could see being good.

This was so so ahead of its time. This was not far off from [[TV/Veep\|Veep]] levels. And we're in the 30s. WW2 is happening. That was the big sticking point we ran into. That perhaps the criticisms that the movie wasn't far off from propaganda were true. I just tend to fall on the speak truth to power. When is the timing ever convenient?
