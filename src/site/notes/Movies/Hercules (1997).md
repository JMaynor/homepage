# Review

Oh Hercules...I hadn't seen this one in years and I had very good memories of it but we really do have some trouble here. There's a lot of issues with Hercules and none of them are easy to fix.

First, the tone is all over. The best bits of the movie are the more serious dramatic moments. The well of souls bit, when Megaera gets got by the column. But we yo-yo back and forth between goofy slapstick and the serious. I think the movie would have been way better if we'd just focused on the drama. Kids can totally enjoy serious things, ok? I promise you they are not stupid.

Second, is I feel there are narrative structure issues here. Why is that all of the Gods get beat to hell but then Hercules shows up and suddenly they curbstomp Hades and the Titans? Even though Herc didn't really do all that much. The whole ending sequence is no good and really needs to be changed. But I don't know specifically what we should do to fix it. This one needs rewriting.

The weird product placement also really took me out. Why are we referencing [[People/Marilyn Monroe\|Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Movies/Midnight Cowboy (1969)\|Midnight Cowboy]] in this kid's movie? It felt so weird and jarring. The Air Jordan's? What are we doing?

Magicâœ¨? I dunno...
