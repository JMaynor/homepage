# Review

I believe I've watched Hannibal fully twice and am going through a third watch. We're on season two as of this writing. I really enjoy it, It repeatedly surprises me with moments of "this was on TV?". (Or the things that TV randomly decided were unacceptable, the Primavera incident) I believe I started watching it shortly after the first season ended sometime late 2013. I was there when the S2 finale dropped and we all picked our jaws back off the floor.

One of the things I enjoy most about the show is the turn from the first couple episodes to what the show ends up becoming. You would not be wrong to think you're watching a fairly standard monster-of-the-week. With the greater Baltimore area serving as an oddly high-density murder grounds for a group of serial killers. And it could have gone that way and remained relatively pedestrian. But the change is what I really love. In a way that's not too dissimilar to what happens in [[Movies/Psycho (1960)\|Psycho]]. Where we see the money, laying forgotten, and we do the scene transition to Norman. "*This* is what the movie's about." Some of Hannibal's most memorable moments (or at least the ones I often find myself mentioning to others) is the ridiculously over-the-top kills. But that ain't what the show is about. The show is about Will and Hannibal in a room talking. The dialogue! Oh my god...It's insane. The teacup...

Speaking of our titular villain(?), [[People/Mads Mikkelsen\|Mads Mikkelsen]] does an excellent job with the Hannibal character. Something I appreciate about the show is that we have a *completely* different interpretation of the character. We're not doing an [[People/Anthony Hopkins\|Anthony Hopkins]] impression in the slightest. They're the same person, but it's acted so differently and they feel so distinct to me. I'm glad we went that route, because I never really compare them in my mind. Had we gone for an Anthony Hopkins again, I think it would have invited a lot more comparisons and I'm sure would have fallen down. As it is, our tempting Lucifer-esque Hannibal is a joy to watch. He lures you in and makes you see his point of view. I know he's a monster but there are so many times in the show where you truly start rooting for him.
