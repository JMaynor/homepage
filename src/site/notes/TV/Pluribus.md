# Review

## Season 1

Really enjoyed the first season of this show. Hope it remains as good as it was going forward. Carol is a really strong protagonist. She is surly and combative in just the right way. The bullshit that she has to put up with. And reeling from the death of her wife the whole time...She comes across as very believable and likable to me.

The first episode in particular is a marvel watching the tragedy play out. Had me totally glued to the screen the whole time. Not that subsequent episodes are any worse, really, just that that first one really knocks it out of the park and gets you perfectly invested.

In addition to loving Carol, I really enjoyed Us. We are a surprisingly interesting character. I wasn't sure how that would work on an actual character -drama level. It's always fun watching Us do things at the drop of a hat. We can accomplish a lot when we work together! Seeing a bunch of people come out of nowhere to do something never gets old. But I really liked the relationship between Carol and Us. It does notably develop and change.

Looking forward to more seasons. I went agaisnt my usual rule. Typically, I just am not interested in watching a show when it comes out. Too many times I've been fucked over by shows that get cancelled or shit themselves as they go on. But Pluribus got a pretty glowing recommendation from RedLetter Media and I trust them. Additionally, I'm gonna guess that Vince Gilligan has some amount of leeway, given his history, that he'll be able to finish things to his satisfaction. That's my hope.
