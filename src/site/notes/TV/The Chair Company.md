## Season 1

Some lovely Tim Robinson fare. This one is definitely more surreal than the typical I Think You Should Leave sketch. There's a couple moments where we're barely doing comedy and it's more just played for straight up horror, or at least creating anxiety. A lovely Lynchian area to play in. I do get degrees of the Return in here.

In the Chair Company, Robinson plays a middle manager-esque project lead on an Ohio-based mall. After giving a speech on stage, his chair embarrassingly breaks on him. We are then lead down a vast conspiracy. I love the constant push and pull from a surprising reveal to the realization that this is nothing. It just gets funnier the deeper we go. Additionally, we have the standard insane world where you'll see a seemingly normal person, made of well-understood tropes suddenly devolve into complete madness. Bar man with sleeve in bowl was a highlight for me.

Overall good, first episode is a little bit weaker. I think we hit our stride in the second episode on when we start introducing the various townies Robinson's character runs into.
