# Review

Diner Bros seems like a game that should be way more popular than it is, especially with the streaming audience. It is purpose-made exactly for that crowd. Cutesy, high-stress, accidents that are made very prone to exploding and causing full system reboots to happen in the brain. So many times I can recall us playing the game, my mind is juggling like 5 thoughts. One ball eludes my grasp and suddenly, the whole train of thought comes crashing down. I have no idea where I am, what I'm doing, or why the cooks are suddenly very angry with armfuls of food that needs to go somewhere. And oh jesus! There's the critic who is about to get up out of their seat because I haven't served them in 30 minutes. Great fun. Would love to see more from the dev.
