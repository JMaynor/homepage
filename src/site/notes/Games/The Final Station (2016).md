# Summary

The Final Station is a side-scrolling shooter adventure game released in 2016. It was developed by by Do My Best Games and published by tinyBuild. You play a train conductor transporting people and cargo in the midst of a world-changing event that is turning people to monsters.

I've been in a retro kick lately, there's been a number of pixely games on my radar. I like the idea of this one, going back and forth between the train segments and the city exploration bits. And yes, I do quite like trains.

# Review

I liked it well enough. I felt that the gameplay got a bit same-y and I was ready to be done with it by the end. But I quite liked the visuals and was interested in what was going on. Didn't like some of the dialogue. Felt like it was being fed through google translate or something. There was some typos and strange word choice, that I would've liked if it had gotten a once-over.
