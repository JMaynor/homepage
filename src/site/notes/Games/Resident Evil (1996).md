# Summary

Resident Evil is a survival horror game (some would say the definer of the genre) originally released in 1996. It was developed and published by Capcom for the PlayStation. We will be playing the remastered HD version that came out in 2002 and got released for a number of consoles and later the PC. In Resident Evil, you play as either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine who are sent to investigate a series of bizarre murders. Someone didn't get the memo that zombies were back...

Resident Evil has been on my mind to play for a while. I knew I wanted to eventually get to this and the Silent Hill series. Recently, I've come upon the idea of filling out my personal knowledge of the classics and going through the best and most notable games that I have not myself played. Thus, we find ourselves here ready to die a number of times while solving silly puzzles.
