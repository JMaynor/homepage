# Review

I can't stand anime for its naming. I don't know why people consider it acceptable. It's not and if people would just stand up for common decency, maybe we could live in a utopia world. Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep â€“ A Fragmentary Passage. A part of the Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue collection. Jesus christ.

Great fun! [[Games/Kingdom Hearts 3D Dream Drop Distance (2012)\|Dream Drop]] was darkness within darkness and nearly broke me. So it was nice spending a bit of time with the best of the BBS trio. I mean the game is a glorified tech demo of KH3 so it kind of by definition can't overstay its welcome. But I think the short runtime and the severe increase in gameplay from the previous one to this does a lot to garner favor. Also, I like the focus on stopping and observing, particularly with regards to the Phantom Aqua fights.

Mickey's shirt disappearing is still so stupid it's funny.

Last, but certainly not least we have the big one, [[Games/Kingdom Hearts 3 (2019)\|Kingdom Hearts 3]].
