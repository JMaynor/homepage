# Review

Big improvement from [[Games/Four Last Things (2017)\|Four Last Things]] and I totally enjoyed Four Last Things. Loved that we have a path where we can slice and stab our way through all the puzzles. Why is that not always an option, hmm? Even if it led to a bad end, I love that it was there.

I'd say was pretty much better in all ways. The humor is as good as ever. I love that a not insignificant amount of time there's just people screaming being crucified in the background. Absolutely ridiculous. The main character in this one was particularly enjoyable. She is so driven...

And now to [[Games/Death of the Reprobate (2024)\|Death of the Reprobate (2024)]].
