# Review

Big improvement from [[Games/Four Last Things (2017)\|Four Last Things]] and I totally enjoyed Four Last Things. Loved that we have a path where we can slice and stab our way through all of the puzzles. Why is that not always an option, hmm? Even if it led to a bad end, I love that it was there.

And now to [[Games/Death of the Reprobate (2024)\|Death of the Reprobate (2024)]].
