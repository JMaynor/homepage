# Review

Another great entry in the [[Games/Class of '09 (2021)\|Class of 09]] series. These games are just funny. I think there were a couple fewer standout individual jokes than in the previous game, but the humor remains pretty consistent.

Favorite ending was when Nicole joins MySpace. Very good and dark. Emily was the best new character in the spotlight for sure. Though the mall cop was a very close second. I like that by this point in the series Jecka will sometimes straight up tell Nicole that she needs meds and therapy and is no good. Our girl Jecka's about as close to a straight man as we have in this universe. Kylar has never done wrong.
