I had played most of KH3 prior, when it first came out. I thought it was mostly fun. But I was so much older than when I had first started playing the series. It just wasn't hitting me. The anime had become too much. The cringe too powerful. And I never ended up finishing it. I believe I got all the way to the last world, but just didn't do it.

But this time...what a complete turnaround. After the sheer darkness of [[Games/Kingdom Hearts 3D Dream Drop Distance (2012)\|Dream Drop]], KH3 felt like a land of milk and honey. It's so fun to play! And so sincere. I love all the Disney. I didn't even want the stupid original characters. All I wanted was Sora, Doubloon, and Gondor to have silly Disney adventures. And that is largely what I got. I remember when the game first came out, people were disappointed that most of the plot development happens in the last world and most of the game is just the silly Disney adventures. That couldn't be more what I wanted at this point...

It was quite sad though when all we had was the dumb Organization shit at the end. So little Disney fun to carry us through the dark times. Fun battles, though. I think we coulda stopped with KH2.
