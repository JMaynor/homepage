# Summary

Rome: Total War?...Total War: Rome?...Rome Remastered: War in Totality? is a strategy game originally released in 2004. It was developed by Creative Assembly and published by Activision (now Sega. Corporatism...) We will be playing the remaster that came out in 2021. In it, you play as...Rome. There is...war?

I am so very afraid. Strategy is far from my bread and butter. But I'm covering best games of all time and Total War stuff is frequently mentioned there. In addition, a general goal I've had is covering at least one game in every genre. So it's time.
