# Summary

Call of the Sea is an adventure/puzzle game developed by Out of the Blue and published by Raw Fury. It was released in December 2020.

Let me know if you enjoyed and stick around, there's more on the way! Also, if you have any suggestions for future games or improvements I can make, definitely do so. I'm sure I'll continue fiddling around with the video and audio in future videos until I'm satisfied.

# Review

First game I LP'd. Was fun, not overly difficult so I don't recall there being any puzzles that tripped me up too bad. Could've been a lil bit longer, but at least didn't over stay its welcome.
