# Summary

System Shock is a first-person action-adventure RPG originally released in 1994 by LookingGlass Technologies. We will be playing the remake that came out in 2023, developed by Nightdive Studios. In it, you play as a nameless hacker up against the big grandmammy of all the evil AIs, SHODAN, on a cyberpunky space station.

Very exciting, this is another in the long list of "best games of all-time" that I intend on playing in the near future. Has been on my list for eons, partially because it seemed like the remake would never actually come out. But here it is for all to enjoy! And soon the second game is also getting a remaster. Will very likely cover it soon after I finish this one.

Will review once completed.
