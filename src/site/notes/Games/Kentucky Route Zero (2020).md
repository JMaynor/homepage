# Summary

Kentucky Route Zero is an point-and-click adventurey narrative-driven game from 2013 developed by Cardboard Computer and published by Annapurna Interactive. It's episodic, having five acts. The game is about a man named Conway and the strange people he meets on his way to cross the mysterious "Route Zero" in Kentucky.

This seems like a fun little indie game I've been wanting to play for a while. Very artsy and dialogue-heavy, but real pretty and stylized.

# Review

I think about this one often. It didn't completely work for me. There's parts that I think go on a bit too long. The intermission where you're watching the show. It went on so long I started skipping dialogue. But it was overall very enjoyable and felt so original. Like I was experiencing something I never had before.
