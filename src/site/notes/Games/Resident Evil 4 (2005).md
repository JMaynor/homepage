# Summary

Resident Evil 4 is a survival horror game released in 2005. It was published and developed by Capcom. We will of course be playing the 2023 remake, as I've done with the previous titles. In RE4 we play as Leon Kennedy (my boy) who has been put on a mission to rescue the President's daughter. Rather a big promotion from when we last saw him slumming it up in the Raccoon City Police Department (RIP).

Another game I've been quite excited for. I was aware prior to beginning this series of games that 1, 2, and 4 are widely regarded as some of the best of all time. And I would pretty well agree with that from what I've seen thus far. So interested to see where we go, because this feels like it's gonna be a big departure from the previous games, given the vastly different setting.
