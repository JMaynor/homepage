# Summary

Amnesia: Rebirth is the third in the series of psychological/survival horror games developed by Frictional Games. It was released for PC and PS4 on 20 October 2020. In Rebirth you play as "Tasi" Trianon, exploring the desert ruins and alien landscapes of Algeria in 1937 after a plane crash.

I played and loved the first two Amnesia games and am excited to play Rebirth. I didn't know much about the game other than the basic setting while playing, so that's always fun. Enjoy the spooks, scares, and frights!

# Review

Interesting followup to Dark Descent. I played this one before getting around to Machine for Pigs later. I don't think that it was nearly as scary as Dark Descent, but it did have the standout maze sequence with the one guy who's half-transformed and coming after you. Very memorable and good. At the time, I found it quite interesting how much it advanced the plot of the overall series. In hindsight, however, I wonder if it advanced it too much. The series had largely been progressing linearly in time, until Rebirth. Then afterward Bunker went backwards. And I can see why given how this game ends. Wonder if perhaps they somewhat put themselves in a bit of a pickle.
