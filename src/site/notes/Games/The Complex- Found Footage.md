# Summary

Fun little horror-light found footage-style liminal space game. Based on all that Backrooms jazz the kids are all about these days. The game is free, made by "IsarL", and was released in August 2022. Very interesting VHS graphics, yet textures look pretty realistic.

# Review

Totally forgot to go back and review this one once I started reviewing everything since it was just a little standalone.

The visuals are the obvious standout. The environments to a degree, but more so the actual visual filtering. It properly looks like a VHS image. And surprisingly realistic. I'm not entirely sure what it is, but they're doing some magic there that makes the game look rather good.

The game was fairly short, which is ok. Particularly because we're going for a mechanics-lite experience. And I personally always have time for a short and sweet little experience. Not sure if there were any direct monster encounters. I did not happen to have any in my playthrough. Worth playing, though.

I believe there was some followup to this at some point. May need to put it on my list. I would be cool with a slightly more substantial game from this dev.
