# Summary

Resident Evil 2 is a survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. Perhaps you're familiar? It was originally released in 1998. The version we will be playing is the 2019 remake. Because, you know, it's nice when we can have remakes that are actually good and nice and not just attempts to get more money without actually doing anything meaningful to improve on the original. In RE2, you play as either Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield. Unfortunately the zombies were not in fact confined to last game's mansion. Umbrella be Umrella-ing and Raccoon City is foul now. So one could say that the stakes have in fact been upped.

I'm rather excited to delve further into Resident Evil. I had a good time even while playing the first one and so far as I have heard it's all up from here. We got a huge bump in technology here to enjoy as well. The jump from the prior game to this one is wild.
