# Summary

# Review

Maddeningly hard, but tenuously fair. This game demands so much of you. I do enjoy that its candy-coated exterior of cartoony fun. And then you get in and Cuphead pushes you up against a wall. I very much enjoyed Cuphead and also desperately wanted to run away from it. once I *got* it, though, I had a good time. I would like to see a sequel someday. As I have learned in watching some of the real old Disney movies, I really like the rubber-style animation. Where everyone is a shapeshifter and moves in strange ways.

I will say, beanie is the most asshole part of the game. Every boss had a beanie and they were all universally asshole.
