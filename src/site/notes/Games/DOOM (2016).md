# Summary

DOOM (sometimes I see it as DOOM and sometimes as Doom. DOOM feels far more appropriate.) is an FPS developed by id Software and published by Bethesda and was released in 2016 to great critical acclaim. The long anticipated followup to a series that had not had a release in over a decade. In it you play as the Doom Slayer (I think we all know he's gonna be Doomguy), a proper wide man who looks around at his surroundings and says "Welp, here I go killin' again." after some real smooth-brains decide using Hell as a source of energy was a good idea.

Not my usual fare, but I've had an unexpected amount of fun in the past playing traditional FPS's with the Call of Duty series. So I expect to have a good time here. I've heard nothing but praise for the game.

# Review

God bless Doom. It's great! Ain't that somethin'. It's just a great game. It is a game, it is fun to play, and there is no bullshit. I struggle to even get that in depth with it, because this definitely felt like a throwback game. The bosses were super old-school (in a good way). The gameplay loop was totally uncomplicated. There were no ancillary or unneeded systemic additions. Each aspect of the game is a core part of it. And it feels lovely to behold. My original plan was just to play this one. But I had such a good time with it, that I do think playing the other new Dooms is a bit inevitable now. I don't know how it couldn't be. Doomguy is so funny and I'd love to see more of him stomping all over the legions of Hell.
