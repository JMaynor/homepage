# Review

Class of 09 is a beautiful thing. It is laugh-out-loud hilarious for the vast majority of its playtime. The humor is so dense that, although I do want to play the other stuff in the series, I gotta wait on it. It was dense like fudge, and if we immediately streamed more, I would feel like I'm doing it a disservice. As though I was just chugging a fine wine. It needs t0 be savored and appreciated.  After Tyler and I finished streaming, I had a terrible headache from laughing for such an extended period. Future Class of 09 streams will be a special occasion thing.

Nicole and Jecka are friend-shaped and I think we all need to be more like them. They are role models.
