# Review

KH2 is far and away one of the most fun overall games in the series to play. The combat feels amazing. It feels fluid and purposeful. You have a lot of options in any given situation. In particular, I like just how much your movement and capabilities evolve over the course of the game. Unlocking combat abilities that allow you to close distance in different ways always feels satisfying. And the various drive movement abilities also feel good to unlock. The drives as a whole and their relationship with the MP charge stage added a great depth to moment-to-moment combat.

I think KH1 has a certain purity to it that later entries don't. There's a simplicity to it that comes with being the first game in a series that is set up in a way that it doesn't necessarily need sequels. [[Games/Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories (2004)\|Chain of Memories]] began the process of expanding the lore into a series and KH2 doubles down on that. I enjoy the Organization even if they're hilariously nonsensical. And the Disney fun remains present which is still the core of the game.

I really enjoyed the additions from Final Mix. The data battles of the Organization felt like a good victory lap/final test. Also satisfying for inner child who was pissed at Japan for refusing to release the version. And of course there was Lingering Will. I would say that was the most difficult boss I've ever fought in a game. I try thinking of more difficult ones and I come up short. I guess some Soulsborne boss potentially (Gael maybe?), but I know with certainty I've never had to iterate so many times until I could demonstrate near-perfect mastery of a game's combat system. So that was fun. Definitely good additions considering how easily you can overpower everything in the main game once you're at the tail end of the power curve. It was satisfying to have things to do where, even at that point, it's still a struggle.

Next on the list is [[Games/Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep (2010)\|Birth By Sleep]].
