# Review

Again, great designs. The tall man was most definitely my favorite. And all the more interesting once we learn who he is. Also greatly enjoyed long arm lady coming after me in the ducts. I enjoyed the switch in this game, making the protag of [[Games/Little Nightmares (2017)\|Little Nightmares (2017)]] your companion. Although after what happened in that one, kinda hard to trust her...Every time she sneezed I was squinting my eyes waiting for things to explode. Will definitely play more games in this series if they come out.
