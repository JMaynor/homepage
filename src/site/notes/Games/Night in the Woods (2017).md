# Summary

Night in the Woods is an indie adventure game released in 2017. It was developed by Infinite Fall and published by Finji. The game follows Mae Borowski, a college dropout who returns to her coal mine town of Possum Springs. She reconnects with her friends and discovers that the town has taken a turn for the worse. Strange things are happening in Possum Springs.

I played some of NitW a number of years ago but didn't get too far. Wanted to return to it after it had been recommended to me and I finished Pentiment, which has some clear DNA from this game.

# Review

Fun, though after having played [[Games/Pentiment (2022)\|Pentiment (2022)]], was a little bit lacking. Not through its own fault. Night in the Woods walked so Pentiment could run. It is what it is advertised as. A silly little animal slice of life with a patina of cosmicism and weirdoism.
