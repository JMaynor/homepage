# Review

A fun little ditty. Had way more work put into it than I expected going in. Surprising number of race types. Lady Maria and Micolash were my favorite. Micolash probably being the standout with his silly mirror shit. Clearly a labor of love.

Sony can suck a fucking egg. What in the flying fuck are they doing with the IP? Shit like Bloodborne Kart really makes me want to tear down all IP law and let the chips fall where they may. Radical? Sure. But I have said numerous times that I am desperate to give them money to play actual [[Games/Bloodborne (2015)\|Bloodborne]] on my PC and they have up to this point shown no interest in that. So I got no sympathy for their lawyers going after hobbyists who are very clearly celebrating their IP. The whole "we gotta go after every instance of someone using our copyright no matter the circumstance" is a horseshit modern era excuse for people to stop being human and become subservient to banally evil systems because it's easier and allows them to opt out of thought. What harm, financial or otherwise, was Bloodborne Kart causing? None. Anyone who bothered to think for 2 seconds and make an actual human deliberation could see that. So there's no excuse. We got eight billion people running around and you're telling me that we simply cannot possibly be bothered to find anyone to stop and actually think about something for 2 seconds? And that it all has to be this largely automated combine tearing its way across human endeavor? No, no. Fuck em.
