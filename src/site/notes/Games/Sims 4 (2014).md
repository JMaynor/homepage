# Summary

# Review

Oh, Sims. Monumental in its assurance there will never be a competitor. Probably not wrong. Who's doing it like her? I really enjoy the Sims. I also kind of hate the Sims. I mean, it's fun, don't get me wrong. But it's so rotten with the DLC. The actual core gameplay is very satisfying and I find it unlikely that there will come a day that someone else fills that niche without also losing the crazy energy and humor that makes Sims Sims.
