# Summary

Call of Duty Black Ops is an FPS game developed by Treyarch and published by Activision in 2010. If you weren't aware. The series has a bit of a following, actually.

We have truly entered a new era in this series. Gone are the days of Nazis and Kareninicks. We are right proper into the modern games. Obama is fully in the White House! We've come quite a long way. And now we're doing gray morality silliness in the cold war. Fun!

# Review

I *wanted* to dislike it. I can *see* the propaganda. I could feel throughout the whole thing the miasma of militarism and all the worst things that rightfully get levied at the series. That final scene before the credits... But...I had quite a lot of fun. Way more fun than I expected to have going in. Which has been quite the running theme in this series. Even just looking back at my reviews of the previous games it comes up repeatedly. I can understand why the series became as monolithic as it did. I do wish I hadn't bothered with the super big balls difficulty and stuck to the next to last one. I wanted to push myself, which I think is worthwhile, but it did cause undue frustration. Oh well, c'est la vie.

I enjoy that I now I understand the numbers, Mason, and what they mean. Though looking back, Ed Harris is such bastard! Like he fully tortures Mason! Very mean and rude of him. I enjoyed the romance between Mason and Frank. Very heartfelt.

I will say I feel so unsure on the future of the series. We're proper in the griminess now. I have two conflicting thoughts. I don't wanna do more because I know what I'm going to see. But also there's a sense of journalistic pride. Like I *have* to cover the other games, otherwise who will? A silly notion, but one that's there. Not sure. I've been taking a break from it either way. There's so many games that don't have ick on them.
