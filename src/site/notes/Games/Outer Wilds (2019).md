# Summary

Outer Wilds is an action-adventure (that much-beloved utterly generic genre everything under the sun gets lumped into) game developed by Mobius Digital and published by Annapurna Interactive in 2019. It was released on PC, XBox, and PS4. The game is about an alien astronaut going on their first flight, off to discover the secrets of their mysterious solar system.

Another game that's been on my list for quite some time. Love the general aesthetic it has and how cozy it all feels.

# Review

Delightful, wonderful, joyful, magical. A joy to play front to back. I really have no notes. It became my favorite game of all time in the brief period between it and [[Games/Disco Elysium (2019)\|Disco Elysium (2019)]].
