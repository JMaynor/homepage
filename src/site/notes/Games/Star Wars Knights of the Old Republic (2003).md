# Summary

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is an RPG developed by Bioware and published by LucasArts. It was released in 2003, originally for the Xbox 360 and later for Windows.

In this Let's Play I'll be joined by my friend William and perhaps some other guests along the way! The playthrough is a (mostly) blind one. I myself have not played the game and didn't know much about it while playing. William knew more but had not completed the game himself. So join us on an adventure a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

# Review

Thought it was fun while playing (though terribly terribly dated, controls were no good), but it suffers greatly from the hindsight comparisons drawn after playing [[Games/Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II (2004)\|KOTOR2]]. KOTOR1 is the Fallout 3 to KOTOR2's [[Games/Fallout New Vegas (2010)\|New Vegas]]. Obsidian is just a way more interesting company than Bioware when it comes to story and characters for me.
