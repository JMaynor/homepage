# Summary

American Arcadia is a puzzle platformer released in 2023. It was developed by Out of the Blue Games and published by Raw Fury. You play as Trevor, an entirely ordinary man lead by Angela on an escape from America's most popular TV show, in a Truman Show homage.

Fun returning to these folks given I started with their first game, Call of the Sea, so very many years ago. Happy to see they're making more stuff and I love the 70s visuals they've got going in this one.

# Review

Interesting game, deeply deeply depressing. Even when, I think, it's trying to present a silver lining. Like it was genuinely depressing enough that it was bumming me out at times. Made all the more effective because of its cartoony exterior. I enjoy this company and I will probably be following them after [[Games/Call of the Sea (2020)\|Call of the Sea (2020)]] and this.
