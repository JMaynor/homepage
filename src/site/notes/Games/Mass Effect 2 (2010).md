# Summary

The Mass Effect trilogy is a series of action RPG games developed by Bioware and published by EA from 2007-2012. They were originally released for consoles, but have been re-released in 2021 as Mass Effect Legendary Edition. The series follows Commander Shepard and their crew's fight against the Reapers, the Collectors, and much more.

In Legendary Edition, we've gotten a number of graphical improvements, some gameplay changes, as well as the inclusion of all the DLC that was released over the original games' lives. I'm a big fan of the series and am excited to dive back into it. I've made the decision to play it all on Insanity difficulty (Why did you allow me to do that, viewer?). So expect death and lots of it!

# Review

Next up, Mass Effect 2. The clear front-runner of the series. And yet, also the one that has some of the least to do with the overall plot. Hmm...curious. This came up during William's playthrough of either Mass Effect 2 or 3, but if Mass Effect ever gets a TV show, I don't want a recreation of the games. I don't fucking need that and if other people say that they do, they can get fucked and learn to replay a game, if that's what they really goddamn want. No, what I want is a slice-of-life workplace comedy about the experiences of the crew on the Normandy. The thing that Mass Effect excels at is its feeling of camaraderie. That is what you focus on, if you were ever adapting it. I think that would be great. Imagine, just off to the side you have Shepard being Shepard, but what we the viewer get to see is Greg and Bob going on about the new Blasto. I am *telling you*...Nobody understands my genius. Anyway ME2 best.
