# Summary

# Review

Improved from the first game in nearly every way. A recurring thing that happens in this franchise. Every game seems to leap forward in terms of graphics and general play. It's very surprising and lovely to see. I enjoyed the occasional times you get to be next to your partner in this one. It feels so nice with the inhospitable environment. You're alone for extended periods of time, talking to them solely through the walkie talkie and then suddenly they're right next to you. Makes you want to give them a big hug. Clearly something that they expand on in future games.

Also aside from the actual core gameplay loop, I love the setting of this series. weird machinery and castle stuff in the arctic/antarctic is great. Right up my alley.

Obviously, after such a great time being had by all (Sam loved this one even more than the last), we moved on to [[Games/We Were Here Together (2019)\|We Were Here Together (2019)]].
