# Review

Honestly, I'm not sure what I think about 7DTD. I've only played it in multiplayer contexts (and really that's the only context I'm particularly interested in playing it). But we've never really gotten particularly far. So I'm familiar with the very initial base-building and early exploration. But past that, I'm not too familiar with the systems of progression. It seems fun. but people inevitably scream that we *must* start over every time we pick it back up again after a break(one of my personal utter hated behaviors).
