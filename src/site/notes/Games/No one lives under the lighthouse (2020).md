# Summary

No one lives under the lighthouse is a retro horror game released in 2020 and developed and published by Marevo Collective. You play as a lighthouse keeper, who takes over after the previous keeper mysteriously disappears.

I love lighthouses and horror and retro stuff so I love the game already.

# Review

Really enjoyed it. I have a weaknesses for lighthouses and the horror therein. I still find myself a little confused by what exactly was going on. Particularly the latter half of the game once you go under the lighthouse (where nobody lives). I'm not the sort that needs things explained to me. In particular when things are being allegorical rather than direct. [[Movies/The Lighthouse (2019)\|The Lighthouse (2019)]] is in fact my comfort movie, so...I do feel I've missed some important details in connecting what's going on at the beginning of the game to what's going on at the end. I feel like I'm about 60% of the way there, and I'd like to get to about the 75% mark, you know? Might be something that becomes evident if you do the other endings. I don't really care for that, though so it is what it is. I enjoyed it either way.
