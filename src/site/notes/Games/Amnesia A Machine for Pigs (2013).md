# Summary

Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a horror game made by The Chinese Room and published by Frictional Games in 2013. It was released for PC, PS4, XBone, and later Nintendo Switch. Machine for pigs is the sequel to Dark Descent. In it Oswald Mandus, industrialist, must traverse his great creation beneath the streets of London at the turn of the century.

I'm a big fan of the Amnesia series, having already Let's Played Amnesia Rebirth. With Amnesia The Bunker coming out later this year, I wanted to square this circle and finish this game since I had never completed it.

# Review

I can see the complaints. I largely agree with them. I did still enjoy playing it, but it was marred by some important issues. Chief of which, I think, is the fact that there is no danger. The decision to have no limited resources whatsoever, nor have health or sanity made it to where there was no real sense that you were anything but completely safe the whole time. There were scary moments where something started chasing you. But it wasn't an omnipresent threat. I will however say, I loved the general atmosphere. I loved the feeling of being inside the machine. The industrial and mechanical grinding and steamworks that makes everything feel so harsh. Like this is a place no man should be in. That and the excellent narration being used to describe the surroundings.
