# Summary

Alien: Isolation is a horror survival game released in 2014. It was developed by Creative Assembly and published by Sega. The game follows Amanda Ripley, the daughter of beloved Ellen Ripley, and the terrible time she has on Sevastopol Station while searching for the flight recorder of the USCSS Nostromo. Because of course there had to be Xenomorphs involved...

Very excited to play this one. I adore the Alien movies, the first one is in my top 5 of all time, with Aliens not far behind it. So I've had Isolation on my list of games I've wanted to play for quite some time. Ready to die horribly in the crapsack world of Alien!

# Review

Easily one of my favorite horror games. So so good and anxiety-inducing. And so much care was clearly shown. The world of the game, Sevastopol station, is so well-realized with its details drawn directly from the films. The sound design in particular I would draw attention to. The noises the alien makes fucking about in the vents make you sweat. I was very glad to have played it.
