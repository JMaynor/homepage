# Review

What a shocking reversal from interest at the steam page to complete disinterest after playing. Ok, maybe not *complete* disinterest. The actual prose of the game is quite good and I found myself wanting to know more about the library's history. But man, this game drove me to insanity in a period of time that I did not think possible. I wanna stress that I *know* there isn't really a fail state. That became obvious from just the 7ish hours that I played. But it doesn't really feel like that. The think that really made me a stressful mess was the daily disappearance of memories. Something about it just led to this feeling of sand slipping through my fingers. I knew that everything was theoretically infinite. I could do something any day. But you had to accomplish it in one day. You had to find a combination of items that would get you into the next room or unlock the next skill. If you fucked it, that day is done and your efforts wasted.

It felt so bad to me. Which is a shame, because I feel like a more lean version of this would be quite interesting. If the game were less of a puzzle and more literally just organizing the library and learning secrets, that would be great. As it was, while I could imagine there is a point where the systems click and the game starts to play itself, I have zero interest in getting there.
