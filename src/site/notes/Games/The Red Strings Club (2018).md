# Review

Quite fun! A nice little snack coming it at around four hours. More than some indie games that only really have one idea, say it, and immediately leave within an hour or two. But doesn't overstay its welcome. I think it was well-paced. The gameplay was generally interesting, though that last section of the game I felt was particularly good. Really enjoyed the social engineering. I think I'd honestly like to see something like that scaled up into its own game. Add on some detective elements? Feels like there was something there. There was a couple really good a-ha moments. I suspect that you probably couldn't fuck yourself over there and the game would've allowed for brute forcing it. But it still felt and good and in another context could be used to create quite a lot of tension.

The very end after the credits is worrying. A nice read on it would be that it is just the player taking the amnesia pill. I.E. but playing the game over again. But my initial read of it is that the bartender is making themselves a drink. Unable to deal with what's happened. A much darker possibility. Maybe a little too dark? Even though it would be classic cyberpunk. So not sure on that one.
