# Review

I like it thus far. I think I have more of an affinity for the full-on [[Games/American Truck Simulator (2016)\|American Truck Simulator]] experience. Prefer going around places I know and discovering things that actually exist. But the aesthetics are doing a lot of work here. Retro-futurism is excellent. I loved it in [[Games/Outer Wilds (2019)\|Outer Wilds]], [[Movies/Alien (1979)\|Alien]] also comes to mind. Love when we're in the far future, but we've still got the rust and duct tape vehicles. Err excuse me...vehicles with Alabama chrome, rather.
