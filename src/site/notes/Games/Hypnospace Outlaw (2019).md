# Summary

Hypnospace Outlaw is an...umm..sim-like(?) video game released in 2019. It was developed by Tendershoot and published by No More Robots. You play as an enforcer in an alternate 1999, policing the hypnospace internet against copyright infringement, cyberbullying, viruses, and all the nonsense that comes along with the internet of this era.

These visuals absolutely delight me, love the 90s internet. I've heard many good things about this game for some time, so I'm quite excited to get to it.

# Review

Fun game full of heart. I did end up kinda rushing through the story, because I was ready to get through it. Not really an indictment on the game, more just I didn't wanna spend forever let's playing it. Has so much incidental detail that it felt almost a little overwhelming. Would have been more fun if I was just playing it in my own time and didn't have that self-enforced time limit.
