# Review

I have to say, the cute art style of this one really lodged its way in my heart. The even more increased graphics of the next game is great and all, but I love the real differentiation of your two arctic fellas in this one. So, this is the one where they really started emphasizing the being together. Appropriate title. It was really nice. I liked the idea of having your little cozy base you came back to, though if I remember correctly, you're mostly just there in the beginning. Think that could have been a nice place to have as a reward after doing an area. Though, these games aren't particularly long so I can see why it is the way it is. Overall, cuter than ever and puzzles are still going great.

Also, I'm really impressed at how much these games have improved with every iteration. Puzzles remain quite fun and doable. And the graphics and styling gets better every time. Very impressive for a smaller studio.

Last, but not least we have [[Games/We Were Here Forever (2022)\|We Were Here Forever (2022)]].
