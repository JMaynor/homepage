# Summary

Omen Exitio: Plague is a choose-your-own-adventure styled RPG mostly text-based narrative game released in 2018. It was developed by Italian-based company Iron Bull Studios. The game is about a mysterious illness (some might even call it a plague) that threatens to eradicate humanity. You play as Dr. Jake Huntington, a British army soldier in Zanzibar, 1896, who has recently joined to try and forget about the death of his wife Helen. Also there is tentacles and Lovecraft is present for the ride.

Interesting little indie game that's sat in my to-play list of games (also known as the majority of my steam library) for a couple years now. It's indie enough that there isn't a wikipedia page for the game, just for the studio. Whose page is also rather bereft of details. One of them there REAL indie games...

# Review

Fun VN. I feel the ending I got was a bit overly bleak. Even if accurate to Lovecraft and all. It did feel a bit wrong to go through all that and make a deal with the cosmos and it ends up all for naught. I found out later that I seemingly made all the worst possible choices, so that's fun. I suppose I would rather get the bleakest ending than a middling one.

I do want to see what else this company does, and there should be another Omen Exitio coming in the future. We'll have to pretend that ending didn't happen when we get there.
