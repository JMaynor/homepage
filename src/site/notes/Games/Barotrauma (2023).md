# Review

I don't think I've had quite enough experience with Barotrauma to provide a full and comprehensive review. We've generally had plans to return to it at some point, because it's generally liked. And what we have played, has really only scratched the surface.  But my god, we've had real trouble with it. I wanna say we've put in maybe 12-ish hours total to the game. And we have fully gotten nowhere at all. Not even close to establishing a system.

I've no idea how the single player relates to the multiplayer. It seems like it would be difficult to do that. I have only played the multiplayer and have always been the captain. Fun enough, though I do find it to be a bit frustrating as I'm frequently on the end of trying to steer this ship metaphorically and literally and things immediately crashing and burning as assholes deeply desire putting the knife in everyone's backs 5 minutes into the campaign.

Not sure if we're actively doing something wrong or what. The game seems rather difficult to get a handle on. Perhaps just something that comes with more experience. I do think the atmosphere of the game is excellent. Submarines on Europa running into monstrous abominations is entirely up my alley.
