# Summary

# Review

One of my favorite coop games I've played. Sam absolutely loved it so much, it's one of his favorites. We were so so drunk by the time we played this one. I remember Sam and I were doing a "Broskis and Brewskis". A short run of highly cooperation based games we played while intoxicated. Because that's a fun thing. I recall we had just finished Portal 2 around the halfway mark when I pulled this gem out. We were rolling and asked to do puzzles and that did not happen. There was much staring at the screen attempting to solve the great riddle of 2+2. We came back later, though a bit fresher with tails bushy and finished it up.

Of course, had to move right along to the sequel that I immediately purchased for my Samothy, [[Games/We Were Here Too (2018)\|We Were Here Too (2018)]].
