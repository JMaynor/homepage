# Summary

Rogue Galaxy is a JRPG developed by Level-5 and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was originally released for the PS2 in 2007. It later was rereleased in 2015 on the PS4. I'll be recording the gameplay via Sony's PS Remote Play program.

I was a big fan of this game when I played it on the PS2, so it should be quite fun to delve back into it for this Let's Play. I intend on finishing the main story and probably most of the side quests. There's some real time-intensive things later on if memory serves so we'll see how much of it we get through. But in either case, prepare for some space pirate adventure!

# Review

The game clearly showed its age. Was fun enough to play, but not something I'd do if I hadn't been nostalgic for it. It does feel like it's a prime place for franchise potential, as I mentioned in the videos a couple times. But also not surprised it never went anywhere.
