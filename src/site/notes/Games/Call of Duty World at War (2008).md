# Summary

Call of Duty: World at War is a first-person shooter released in 2008. It was developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. It was the fifth game in a lil hidden series you may not have heard of called Call of Duty. We'll be shedding some light on it so the masses can see.

And we continue the COD series, the last of the WW2 era ones we're likely to see. This time we get to see a whole new theater, hitherto unknown to us - The Pacific.

# Review

My opinion of World at War is somewhat more muted than [[Games/Call of Duty 2 (2005)\|Call of Duty 2 (2005)]] before it and [[Games/Call of Duty Black Ops (2010)\|Call of Duty Black Ops (2010)]] after it. Perfectly enjoyable, but it was really wild going from the big bombastic heroism of the previous games to the grim and dark of World at War. Is this what it should have been from the start? Perhaps. I could see that argument. But it did feel strange going there from what we had before. I did appreciate the ✨cinematique✨ of the game. Big step up from the previous ones. I can see how this one pulled the kids in.
