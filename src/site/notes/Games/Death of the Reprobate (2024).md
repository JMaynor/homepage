# Review

I think the Immortal John Triptych improved with each game, always a joy to see. These games have a clear artistic vision. I really wanted more and was disappointed when God came down in the game's ending and said this would be the last. I mean I know it was described as a triptych, but like c'mon man! Your adoring fans want more! Joe Richardson is one to watch. He's got ideas and thoughts and I like his silly worlds.

This one was quite similar to the previous games with the gameplay and puzzles and all that. I do like that each game became ever more over-the-top. In the first one, the unique art style carried it, but often the joke was simply "hey look at this weird painting." In the second one we start gloriously crusading through the silly art world. And now in Death of the Reprobate we burn it all down and end the world. Good sense of progression. Another thing that I quite liked was the inclusion of the powerful Turk. He of many hints. I really feel puzzle games would do well to just have some sort of hint system always. Does it lead to giving up early instead of really trying and exhausting all options? I dunno. I'm in my 30s, so I super don't give a shit about that question any more. I got places to be and people to see. If I wanna move on, knowing that there is a man I can talk to in the game who will directly tell me "Go here and do this" is a great thing.
