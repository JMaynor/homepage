# Summary

Scarlet Hollow is an episodic horror visual novel initially released for early access in 2021. It was developed and published by Black Tabby Games. In it, you arrive in the small coal town of Scarlet Hollow for your aunt's funeral. But much is waking up in the Holler and no one is safe.

I had heard about this one quite some time ago and it ticks a lot of interest boxes for me, so quite excited to play.

# Review

Very fun game. Series is currently on hiatus. I've finished what's out thus far (episodes 1-4). Waiting for more to release, hopefully sometime this year. Will present a full review when complete. Don't want to make any final judgements until then.
