# Review

When first the Circle was playing Zomboid, I wasn't interested in it. We were hot off [[Games/7 Days to Die (2013)\|7 Days to Die]] and I felt that zombies were overplayed. However, after having seen more of it and playing it, I could easily construct an argument that would have been quite convincing to past me to play it. I would say that the game is different from other such survival games because it hones in on a particular point of view. Namely: low to the ground, realistic to a fault. Also, the setting is local for us. Those are interesting aspects to the game that aren't available elsewhere. Most other zombie survival sorts of chaff are very cartoonish. In Zomboid, however, most everything bad that happens to you is from a clear mistake that you made. And the action rarely ventures above just a little bit stressful. But it keeps things at that level always with the fog of war so you're never really free to lower your guard. There are many such times in other games where you can. Wouldn't be fun if it was a constant horde warfare. But it is fun, because again it straddles that line of incidence.
