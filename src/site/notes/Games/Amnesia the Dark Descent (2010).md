# Summary

Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a survival horror game released in 2010 and developed and published by Frictional Games. A groundbreaking game in the horror genre, Amnesia spawned a number of sequels and launched an entire genre of horror let's plays...If ya didn't know. In Dark Descent you play as Daniel, a saint who has never done wrong. We find ourselves trapped in Castle Brennenburg circa 1839 Prussia. We are given the simple mission of killing the castle's lovely proprietor Alexander and remembering what on earth happened to us.

I've long had a replay of Dark Descent on my list of things to do. It just seems like one of those things you *have* to do. This is one I've played before (who hasn't?), but I've covered all the other games in the series on my channel and over the last year have been playing some of the best games of all time. Seems like a reasonable time to revisit DD. See how well it has held up over time and comment on the game's place in the series' larger narrative.
