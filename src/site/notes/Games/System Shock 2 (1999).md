# Summary

System Shock 2 is an action-adventure survival horror RPG (that's rather a lot of adjectives!) originally released in 1999. We are, of course, playing the 2025 remaster by Nightdive Studios. SS2 was originally co-developed by Irrational Games (There's that BioShock pedigree) and Looking Glass Studios. In it, you play as a soldier who must combat an infection that has broken out on a starship. I wonder who might be responsible for that...

Had a great time with the System Shock remake and have heard nothing but good things about the series, in particular this one that seems to get singled out. So I'm interested to see what this one does differently to its predecessor.
