# Summary

Call of Duty 2 is a first person shooter released in 2005 for PC and Xbox 360. It was developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. The game is a sequel to Call of Duty, a game you may have heard of!

I enjoyed playing the Call of Doots 1, so decided to continue the series. Don't say I never did nuthin for ya!

# Review

I think this is still my favorite COD. Again, surprisingly fun. I really enjoyed the sense of heroism married to the commitment to keeping you on the ground and in the thick of it. You're not some supersoldier, you're just some guy. But you're playing a small and important part in something much bigger.
