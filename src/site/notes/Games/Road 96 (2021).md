# Summary

Road 96 is an indie adventure game released in 2021 by DigixArt, a French studio. It was originally released for Windows and Switch and then later came to all the other consoles. It's about hitchhiking on the road attempting to get to the border and cross, fleeing a totalitarian country before the presidential election of 1996. Everyone loves some of that good good indie charm.

Love the art direction and it seems like this game is the epitome of "colorful cast of characters".

# Review

Really enjoyed this one. I feel like it was more than the sum of its parts, it really stuck in my head. I love how wacko insane everyone is. Very fun. The one big negative I felt in the game is that you play as a number of different people, but as you cycle through them, there's no real sense of each of those people being a character. It's the people you're interacting with that are the real characters. Which is interesting, but it did feel a bit strange. Definitely not what most games do.
