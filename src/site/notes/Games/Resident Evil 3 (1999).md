# Summary

Resident Evil 3 is a survival hope game originally released in 1993 and remade in 2020. It was developed and published by Capcom. The third in a small unknown series I just thought I'd shine a little light on and let people know about. In it, you play as Jill Valentine attempting to escape from Raccoon City. It's a tad bit full of zombies these days, unfortunately. Can't imagine who's at fault there.

With RE3, we're now totally outside of my awareness of the series via cultural osmosis. No idea what's going on in this one or any of the future ones. Or if I do, it's so out of context, I wouldn't know which game something even comes from. But I've had a great time with the previous two Resident Evil games and am excited to see where we go from here.
