# Summary

Amnesia: The Bunker is a survival horror game released in 2023, developed and published by Frictional Games. You play as Henri, a French soldier trapped in a bunker during WW1. And of course...you are not alone.

The Bunker is the latest in Frictional's Amnesia series. I've greatly enjoyed their games over the years so excited to see what they do with this one. Bunker is apparently more open-ended. You are allowed more freedom of movement than previous games, with the monster being an omni-present threat.

# Review

Very fun, if a little short. I'm not the type who would be interested in replaying to see how it would differ. I felt that had one more bunker area been present (or if the final section had been longer), I would have been much more satisfied. In addition, I felt there were too many items. I suppose the point of that is you will run into different items in your playthrough than someone else will. Or will run into different things if you play it again. But again, that's not really interesting to me. So for me, I didn't like that there were several tools I never made use of. Felt weird. But monster was proper scary. Excellent return to form after [[Games/Amnesia A Machine for Pigs (2013)\|Machine for Pigs]] and [[Games/Amnesia Rebirth (2020)\|Rebirth]]. Not nearly as smart as the alien in [[Games/Alien Isolation (2014)\|Alien Isolation (2014)]], but I made several comparisons to it. It wasn't dissimilar in feeling.
