# Review

The highs and lows of Lego Star Wars are insane. The sheer elation Alex and I felt as we were playing through the Phantom Menace bit. Really much of the OT and PT. But then...the sequels came. I have never in my life had my opinions sink so low in a game. All of the travesty of the Star Wars sequels was front and center and it was so depressing. What does Snoke do? What does Starkiller base do? I don't know and neither did Lego. It felt increasingly like even the people making the game weren't sure what bits to even focus on. There was long stretches where I barely remembered the bit that the game was parodying. It was so depressing. We had started playing the Lego game as a fun re-experiencing of Star Wars. And oh did we experience Star wars. This game led us down the road of full-throatedly embracing #FuckStarWars.
