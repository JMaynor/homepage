# Summary

Silent Hill 3 is a survival horror video game, the third in the Silent Hill series (shocking). It was developed by Team Silent and published by Konami in 2003 for the PS2. In it we play as Heather Mason, Harry Mason's new and improved (?) daughter. But of course as with a Silent Hill protagonist comes the titular Silent Hill town. And the many monsters and cultists therein.

Loved the previous Silent Hills and I have heard this one is also good and worth playing. We are getting scarily close to that point where I see the descent in front of me and I will certainly pull my ripcord before we get there. But I think we are still in safe hands for now. Know that I, Dear Leader, am closely monitoring the situation and will act swiftly and with great responsibility and care.
