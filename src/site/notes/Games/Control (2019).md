# Summary

Control is an action-adventurey shooter developed by Remedy Entertainment, makers of Alan Wake. It was released in 2019 and has had some expansions since then: The Foundation and AWE. The game is about newly hired Director Jesse Faden exploring the Federal Bureau of Control's headquarters, the Oldest House. Very SCP, they're the government agency responsible for investigating the weird and dangerous things that violate reality.

This game is super up my alley, I love all that weird reality-bending SCP Foundation stuff. Very excited to play this one.

# Review

I feel very conflicted about Control. Loved the worldbuilding, the details. But the gameplay really threw me for a loop. I felt it got so boring. I wish I hadn't done the DLC. I think that was really the breaking point for me. I just did not want to keep doing the moment-to-moment gameplay by then. I cranked the difficulty way down but by the time I was most of the way through the Alan Wake DLC and basically at the end. I think it would have helped if I had done that halfway through the main game. Although what I really want is just more incidence. More aspects of the game you're interacting with. Combat felt good but it was so simple and didn't meaningfully change once you get the flying.
