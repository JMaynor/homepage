# Summary

Call of Duty is a first person shooter released in 2003 for PC. It was developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. The game would go on to spawn a whole franchise, you know, if you've been living under a rock and weren't aware.

I've been in the mood for a good shooty shooty lately and going all the way back to the great grandaddy of modern shooters felt like a great place to start. I might end up covering more of the Call of Duty games on my channel, so if you enjoy, let me know!

# Review

Ended up being surprisingly fun. Was obviously quite dated by today's standards, but I didn't really mind. There was a couple instances of some frustration caused by confusion in what it was they were wanting from me. But I quite liked being a boogie woogie bugle boy. Enough that this would spawn a whole subseries of LPs.
