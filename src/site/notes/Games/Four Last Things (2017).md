# Review

Lovely graphics. Very fun idea to fully stitch together dozens of Renaissance paintings into a little game world. Quite liked the humor as well as the central plot of having to do the seven sins just to get forgiven on a technicality. Good stuff. The actual puzzles generally were ok. I'd say like 70% I could clearly see the order of events I needed to do. They did start to delve into "what am I thinking", which was unfortunate. Overall, I had a good time. I think the puzzles would've worn more thin if the game had been longer, but the 1-2 hour runtime was a very nice sweet spot for what we were doing.

Next in this trilogy we have [[Games/The Procession to Calvary (2020)\|The Procession to Calvary (2020)]].
