# Summary

Doom Eternal is an FPS released in 2020. It was developed by id Software and published by Bethesda Softworks. In it, you play as our favorite little marine Doomguy, who must continue battling the forces of Hell after certain nincompoops were real certain they had everything under control.

This one went way up my list of things to play after having played 2016's Doom and really loving it. Fully expect to continue having a great time with the series.
