# Summary

Smile For Me is a heavily stylized point-and-click adventure game released in 2019. It was developed by LimboLane and published by Serenity Forge. In the game you play as a florist who makes everyone in The Habitat hap-hap-happy! But we better hurry because the Big Event is coming and it may soon be too late...

I have absolutely no idea where I saw this game. It's been sitting in my Steam library for a while. But the visuals were giving me Psychonauts energy and it is in fact significantly more unhinged, so seems very fun. Do you have depression? Well no longer because Dr. Habit will teach us all how to be happy...or else...

# Review

Wildly insane. Wish there was a bit more meat here. It's fun, but it has problems. I'm a big believer in weirdoism, but this one dips its toes a bit too much into the lolrandom puddle for my liking. It's a thin line, but an important one. It's what keeps us grounded and not flying away into Cloud Cuckooland. Things start to become meaningless then. I think that's the primary problem here. There's nothing to grab onto. It's charming certainly, and the cast is colorful (literally). But nothing really means anything. I enjoyed the presentation. Very [[Games/Psychonauts (2005)\|Psychonauts (2005)]].
