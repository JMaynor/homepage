# Review

Generally pretty good. Straightforward in terms of the psychology, a little too straightforward. But it's got some good ideas. I particularly enjoyed the whistling for your dog. Wish that had been played for horror one or more times. There's like one instance at the beginning of the game where someone who is certainly not your dog responds to your whistle. I think I would have waited a bit longer to pull that out the first time. And then perhaps had another time later in the game where it deliberately leads you astray. I did get a little bit of Silent Hill, which I had heard beforehand. Though more in the general sense of most any game post-Silent Hill is going to pull from it as inspiration. But there were a couple instances of jumping down holes and some rusted industrial fans that seemed like more direct callouts.

I do think I like the creator is this game. I enjoyed watching Tyler's playthrough of Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion. And I believe we've also seen a couple creations of theirs in the Dread X series that I recall being good. Someone to watch.
