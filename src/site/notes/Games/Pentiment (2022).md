# Summary

Pentiment is a highly stylized narrative driven adventure RPG developed by Obsidian and released in 2022. It follows Andreas Maler, an artist and illuminator working for an abbey in 16th century Bavaria. You become embroiled in a series of murders and must navigate the changing world around you.

Gorgeous game and as a fan of Obsidian's style of storytelling, I think this has quite the potential to it. The Steam description read off like a list of things that I'm interested in which is always an excellent sign.

# Review

Very enjoyable story. Love the whole idea of getting to know a place over a period of many years. First act and third were a little slow at times, but the second in particular sped by like a good book. And the game *is* a good book. Even the visuals are certainly unique. I love how much love is evident in the game. Not a period of time I have any particular love for or care of, but I could feel the interest the authors had and that made me interested.
