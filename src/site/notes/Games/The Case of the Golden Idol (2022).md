# Summary

The Case of the Golden Idol is a detectivey adventure/puzzle game developed by Color Gray Games and published by Playstack. It was released in 2022. In it, the player follows the titular mysterious golden idol as it passes through a number of hands throughout the 18th century. You collect information from a number of still scenes to understand what's going on.

The artstyle of this one immediately leaped out at me when I first saw it. It quickly went on my list after seeing some of the weirdo gameplay. I quite enjoy detective games.

# Review

Far and away the most detective game I've ever detective'd at. I enjoyed that it properly asked me to deduce. Most detective or detective-adjacent games don't really do that. They go through the motions, but they never really ask you to understand what is happening in front of you. I think of L.A. Noire and how you're really led right down the order of events.

I don't have an infinite appetite for games like this, but it was a rare gem and quite enjoyable. Will definitely play the sequel when it comes out.
