# Reading Notes

> I am the island.

Very fun little novel. Made for a good followup, in a way, to [[Books/Daniel Defoe - Robinson Crusoe\|Robinson Crusoe]] which I recently read. I had no idea how quickly Maitland was gonna completely lose his mind. I quite like the setup of calling a disused and forgotten piece of land between some overpasses an "island". I wouldn't have thought of such a thing.

Every time Maitland rambles on about conquering nature and the island and holding dominion over it is hilarious. Traffic literally passing by him 50 feet away.
