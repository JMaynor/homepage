# Review

I've decided I hate the chorus. They're such a nothing that does so little to move anything along. We speak back and forth to them but it's so weird. Because they're not a real person. They're just this narration machine that's shaped like a character. It very much feels like Sophocles threw in a part for some of his kids to play that they couldn't fuck up. I dunno, it feels like something that would surely go away in time as we understand better how to convey information that the characters themselves (the actual characters) wouldn't have reason to talk about. We'll get there.
