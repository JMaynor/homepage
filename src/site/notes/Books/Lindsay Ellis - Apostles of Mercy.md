# Review

Noticeably less depressing than [[Books/Lindsay Ellis - Truth of the Divine\|Truth of the Divine]]. I actually felt hope! I'm quite interested in seeing where the plot is going. I don't really like that it feels like we put off larger developments in this book. I was really expecting imminent invasion or perhaps Cora gallivanting off into the stars. So was a little surprised that neither happened. But I really like the last couple lines of the novel. I find it interesting seeing how bonding with Ampersand has changed her and made her think "You know what, fuck it. Maybe we *should* rule." And I can see how Ampersand has changed over time on the other end. Maybe together they *can* save us! Who knows.

I wish I knew how many books the Noumena series is going to end up being. I like knowing the general percentage of the whole story a particular novel takes up. Helps with expectations and such. But I think this has definitely become a fun little series I intend on keeping up with.
