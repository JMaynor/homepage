Unlike [[Books/Homer - The Iliad\|The Iliad]], I do have experience with the Odyssey. Back in grade school, we did cover it at one point. I'm certain it was some sort of abridged version, because I doubt we would've gone the whole poetic mile. But I'm at least familiar with what all this one covers.

# Reading Notes

This god*damn* translator! I hate these goddamn Roman names! Motherfucker, what book are we translating? Would it be the Ulyssey? Because I don't think that it is. Standard Ebooks, why have you done this to me? Look, I get that norms have changed over time. And it's not like we're even consistent about who gets to be Greek and who's Roman (Heracles found dead in a ditch). But god, it just sucks. I know I could look around. It's the Odyssey, there's a millionty billion translations. But I really like Standard Ebooks. They're standard! Nice formatting, great mission statement. I like them. So whatever. Fucking fine. What's cloud-compelling Jove up to this time? I do like that in the little intro, the translator was having to defend their decision to use the Roman names in their Iliad translation. Even back in the 1800s, they were getting pushback. I don't care for the gaslighting where he tells me that he simply must use Roman, because the audience has literally no idea who Hera, Demeter, or Athena are. Fuck off.
