Unlike [[Books/Homer - The Iliad\|The Iliad]], I do have experience with the Odyssey. Back in grade school, we did cover it at one point. I'm certain it was some sort of abridged version, because I doubt we would've gone the whole poetic mile. But I'm at least familiar with what all this one covers.

# Reading Notes

This god*damn* translator! I hate these goddamn Roman names! Motherfucker, what book are we translating? Would it be the Ulyssey? Because I don't think that it is. Standard Ebooks, why have you done this to me? Look, I get that norms have changed over time. And it's not like we're even consistent about who gets to be Greek and who's Roman (Heracles found dead in a ditch). But god, it just sucks. I know I could look around. It's the Odyssey, there's a millionty billion translations. But I really like Standard Ebooks. They're standard! Nice formatting, great mission statement. I like them. So whatever. Fucking fine. What's cloud-compelling Jove up to this time? I do like that in the little intro, the translator was having to defend their decision to use the Roman names in their Iliad translation. Even back in the 1800s, they were getting pushback. I don't care for the gaslighting where he tells me that he simply must use Roman, because the audience has literally no idea who Hera, Demeter, or Athena are. Fuck off.

Only just finished the first 4 chapters, but appreciating the inclusion of a plot in this one. As opposed to a bunch of shitheads sitting around jacking off for 24 chapters like in the Iliad. Also, I'm fairly sure whatever version of the Odyssey we got peddled in grade school filtered out massive amounts of it. Absolutely none of the pre-Odysseus stuff is particularly familiar. Other than in the abstract, I'm aware of the setup of the story. Don't really recall Telemachus going anywhere. Also, I'm fairly sure whatever version I read did actually start with the Polyphemus incident or maybe the lotus-eaters. So I imagine it just rewrote everything to be in chronological order for the kids. Rather than previous events getting recounted via in-story storytelling.

I do also enjoy that we are occasionally going back and forth between people. Proper meanwhile. This was happening over here, meanwhile the blue-eyed maid Pallas is sending out phantoms to do her dread work over there. We are progressing with the storytelling, people. There's dimensions. Still would like for us to stop referring to people with their epithet every single time. That still annoys me.

There is way less wacky mythological adventures with monsters in the Odyssey that I remember and I strongly suspect the rest of the public remembers. We are blazing through all the notable moments in like a couple chapters and there's a lot of book left to go. I have to assume we waffle around Ithaca way longer than expected.

I fucking hate some of these insane moral lessons we're being taught. So let's talk about the whole Helios cow situation. So it's storming continuously for long enough that the Odyssey crew go through absolutely all of their supplies. (Storming because Zeus mind you) Odysseus is then magically lulled to sleep and his crew kill the cows. Helios is pissed off naturally and demands redress. Poseidon loves fucking up Odysseus for literally the most insane of reasons. Odysseus didn't allow Poseidon's son to eat him and his crew. A horrible sin. So Zeus blows apart his sumptuous barque and sends the crew straight to Hades. Then the Phaecians escort Odysseus to Ithaca and shower him with the wildest level of neighborly kindness. So Poseidon turns their boat to stone? Fucking why???? This theme keeps coming up of how to treat guests. But the ones who treat guests well are punished, while the others are endlessly rewarded. Polyphemus gets an unending blood debt that Poseidon, bitch that he is, will never forget about. Nothing happens to the Laestrygonians. Nothing happens to Circe or Calypso. But no, the Phaecians in particular we really gotta punish them. Fuck these stupid gods. I genuinely don't understand what the Ancient Greeks are getting from this lesson-wise. There's no rhyme or reason.

We do in fact waffle around Ithaca way longer than expected.
