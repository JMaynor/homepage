# Review

I should probably say why on Earth I was reading this. Given I do not have an artistic background. And have only a passing interest in aesthetics. Well, it's silly. I don't recall how I originally found it, but I read [this blog post](https://substack.com/@etiennefd/p-99325295) and really liked the image used at the top. Particularly this fella.

![William Hogarth Analysis of Beauty Plate 1 Farnese Hercules.png|200](/img/user/_sys/Attachments/William%20Hogarth%20Analysis%20of%20Beauty%20Plate%201%20Farnese%20Hercules.png)

He seemed so familiar, but I couldn't place it. That being said, he stuck in my mind as just this...really good shape. For a couple of days, I found that the image would return to me unbidden. Come to find out it's only one of the most famous pieces of ancient Greek sculpture, the [Farnese Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnese_Hercules). (Actually Roman, but thought to be a copy of a Greek original.) And I, the culturally deficient baboon that I was, didn't immediately recognize it as such.

On a lark, I decided to read the book the image actually came from. It was perfectly short. Also because I've taken a mild interest in art history recently. It didn't end up being all that interesting to me. A book on aesthetics is well outside of my wheelhouse. But I didn't mind following along with the pictures and seeing what Hogarth was saying. I can also pick out the grand and magical serpentine line now. He's not wrong, though. It does give an immediate sense of life and beauty that a more straight figure does not. An odd experiment on my part in branching out my literary tastes. But there is something there that I like. Looking at a piece of art while someone more knowledgeable about it breaks down its elements and its history is quite enjoyable.
