[[TV/Twin Peaks\|Twin Peaks]]

# Review

I would highly recommend The Secret History of Twin Peaks to any Peakers out there. Fascinating things in there. Answered many questions while raising a number of others. It came out a few months before season 3 and introduced a couple of the characters that would be involved with all that. The [[Books/Mark Frost - Twin Peaks The Final Dossier\|other recent Twin Peaks novel]], also by Mark Frost, apparently heavily deals with the events of season 3 itself so I am very interested in reading it as well.
