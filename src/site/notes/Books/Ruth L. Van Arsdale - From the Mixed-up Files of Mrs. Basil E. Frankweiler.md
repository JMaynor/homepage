# Reading Notes

I like how Claudia and Jamie are written. Always write children characters a little bit older than you think they need to be. It always feels more true to life. I think of how the kids in Goonies talk to each other.

# Review

I always really liked this one. Enjoyed reading about the kids camping out in the museum at night. Was a cool fantasy. We went through it in I want to say 4th or 5th grade. I recall as part of it, we were given soap and asked to carve something as a little activity. I dunno how that increased my understanding of the book, but I recall enjoying doing it.

Reread it recently on a whim (was only like 2 or 3 hour read), and I would say it held up. Good book for kids. It doesn't talk down, has some adult references that are far more clear to me now than when I first read it. Additionally, I think it has some good ideas going on that are worth hearing when your mind is developing. A lot of focus is put on the childrens' internal journeys.
