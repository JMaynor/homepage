# Reading Notes

Have only read the first two chapters, but the language is *wow*. Can say almost immediately that I've never read a book in this style before. Has been on my list to read for a while. I forget where I originally saw it recommended. I believe I was just generally searching for surrealist books. More than likely a desire for more Lynchian things but I don't recall. May have also been looking for some horror. My first impression is that the text feels very rich.

I think this is one of the darker novels I've read. I struggle to think of a worse world that I've seen. It just grinds you down. I keep thinking, how could things possibly be worse than they are. I'm most of the way through it, and I have really enjoyed it. As depressing as it is, I want to know more. I want to know where things are going to go. I hope against hope we find some light somewhere. As impossible as it feels. But this is very much the sort of situation where the smallest showing of resistance is meaningful.

Fuck.
