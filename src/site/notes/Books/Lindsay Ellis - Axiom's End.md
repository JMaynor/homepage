# Review

This was quite good. I found myself really wanting to read the next chapter whenever I got to the end of one, quite the page-turner. Good on you, Lindsay! Really enjoyed the relationship between Ampersand and Cora. Felt believable and interesting. I was always wanting to see more interactions between humans and aliens. Was enjoyable to see the clear differences as well as the obvious similarities.

I was worried going in it might be a little YA, but I didn't feel too many of the trappings. There's a smidge of "the one special person", but it feels more circumstantial than ordained by God, you're not *like* the other girls. So there was some good characterization there. I can imagine it having been an easy bear trap to step into.

Will definitely continue reading this series.
