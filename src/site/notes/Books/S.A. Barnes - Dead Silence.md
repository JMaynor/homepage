# Chapter 1-20

I am enjoying the book thus far, though I feel like not enough has quite happened. Enjoying the main character's perspective and mindset, but chapters come and go with very little going on. I wouldn't mind a little more incidence.

# Chapter 21-24

The memory issues are interesting. Protag not remembering if she's done something terrible to her crewmates before getting out of Aurora. Curious to see how it goes when we get the company folks in there. Imagining Aliens.

# Chapter 25-35

I wish each of the chapters were longer. Feels like each don't cover enough ground. Definitely enjoying the break down, though. About as chaotic as I expected it to be.

I'm curious if we'll be given a specific explanation on the ghosts. We've seen protag has seen ghosts she would have no possible way to know about. So obviously there are in fact ghosts happening, it's not just the ship. But I'm curious as to the specifics of the MAW. If it genuinely does just create vibrations or if there's something more going on with it that would explain why the ghosts are happening.

# Chapter 36-45

Generally enjoyed. Again, each chapter was too short. Also wish the book skewed a bit older. I think it would have really brought it up. Also was wishing things had gotten a bit more mindbendy once we started seeing the past Aurora. Was totally expecting an extended sequence where Protag is there for a bit a la Jack Nicholson getting pulled back into the party and seeing Grady.
