A way of expressing you have done quite literally everything you are capable of in a situation, no matter how lowly. That you will fully prostrate yourself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| I Wanna Die                                 | A statement of pain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| I Wanna Dyad                                | Was used as the title for the final Lego Star Wars stream as a play on words. When the suffering from the sequels hit maximum levels. Entered the wider lexicon as a more extreme version of 'I Wanna Die'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| I'm big and you're small                    | The most empty-headed insult that a braggadocious man could use. No actual argument, just: I am larger and more intimidating than you so I win. Don't think it came from anywhere in particular.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Idiot (x3)                                  | The equivalent of the Dark Souls Point Down gesture. A direction to feel embarrassment at something stupid you've just done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Kylo Rey                                    | Kylo Ren + Rey. Used when referring to either of the characters as an expression of protest and to make fun of the dyad plotline. (The characters being empty and pointless) Can be used more broadly to cast aspersions at Disney-era Star Wars in the general.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Let us philosophize                         | An invitation to stop and discuss a topic in more depth. A silly greekism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Most trusted homosexuals                    | The most elite guards in Ancient Greece. I believe came from a misheard line in a strategy game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Nightmare (x3)                              | Said when something is really the worst. Came from a silly faux-infographic meme I sent Tyler. It said: <br><br>What To Do When Someone Has a Panic Attack<br><br>Feed them LSD and hold their shoulders and shakem profusely while continuously saying "Nightmare! Nightmare! Nightmare!"                                                                                                                                                  |
| No Balls                                    | A dire proclamation of the lack of manhood put upon someone. MUST immediately be denied and disproved by doing whatever you are being No Balls'd about. No exceptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| No Good                                     | Catchall for anything bad, unnerving, nasty, perverse, etc. etc. Particular emphasis on the 'no' can be used to denote scale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Philosopher's Beard                         | All philosophers have to have beards. The larger the beard, the more philosophy it can hold. A silly greekism, though I don't recall where specifically the phrase came from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Si clave                                    | A Tylerism, I have no idea what it means                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Silly Shoes                                 | Mocking and dismissive phrase used against gamers who handicap themselves for no actual reason and play in a worse way entirely for meaningless internet points. Very common in the Soulsborne community. Also can be used in another context to make fun of dipshits buying skins and other such trash in games. The cosmetic garbage itself being referred to as silly shoes. "Woooow, he's wearing silly shoes..." (eye roll)            |
| Stu                                         | Stupid.

| Willi's Curse                               | When someone does something to themselves that directly makes their lives more difficult. But they refuse to change from pure stubbornness. Came from William not using lock-on in the Star Wars game. Equivalent to that one meme where the person is riding a bike and beholden to no one, chooses to jam a stick right in their front wheel.                                                                                             |
