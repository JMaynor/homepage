# Quotes

> "I'm frightened of eggs, worse than frightened, they revolt me. That white round thing without any holes â€¦ have you ever seen anything more revolting than an egg yolk breaking and spilling its yellow liquid? Blood is jolly, red. But egg yolk is yellow, revolting. I've never tasted it."
