> Hello and welcome to my homepage! My name's Jordan and I'm a programmer from Southern Illinois. In my free time I do let's plays on YouTube and I stream on Twitch with a group of friends on the Alderoth Circle. More recently, I've been trying to write more. Blogging, writing creatively, etc. Thus, the website.
