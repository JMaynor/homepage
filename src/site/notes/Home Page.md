> Hello and welcome to my homepage! My name's Jordan and I'm a programmer from Southern Illinois. In my free time I do let's plays on YouTube and I stream on Twitch with a group of friends on the Alderoth Circle.  I keep a more general blog for open-ended thoughts as well as canonical pages on games I play, movies I watch, etc. On those, I like to review them or post any notable thoughts I had.
